# theories

## approaches

»⟮A pragmatic theory⟯« (my term) is ⟮an analysis of pragmatics⟯.
The main ⟮＿pragmatic theories＿⟯ are ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯ and ⟮＿pragmatic act theory＿⟯.

### speech acts (austin, searle)

»⟮Speech act theory⟯« is ⟮＿a pragmatic theory＿⟯ centered around ⟮＿speech acts＿⟯.
⟮＿Speech act theory＿⟯ was ⟮developed by⟯ ⟮JL Austin⟯ in 『⟮How to Do Things with Words⟯』 (⟮1962⟯).
⟮＿Speech act theory＿⟯ was ⟮expanded on⟯ mainly by ⟮Searle⟯.
Both ⟮＿act type＿⟯ and ⟮＿the loc/ill/perl distinction＿⟯ ⟮originate from⟯ ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯

### pragmatic acts (mey)

»⟮Pragmatic act theory⟯« is ⟮＿a pragmatic theory＿⟯ centered around ⟮＿pragmatic acts/pragmemes＿⟯.
⟮＿Pragmatic act theory＿⟯ was developed by ⟮Mey⟯ starting around ⟮2000⟯.
⟮＿Pragmatic act theory＿⟯ has become ⟮the standard sucessor theory⟯ to ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯. 

## specific theories in detail

### Austins original constative/performative distinction

»⟮Austin's original distinction⟯«: ⟮＿constative＿ vs ＿performative utterances＿⟯.
»⟮constative/performative (utterances)⟯« ⟮state a fact/do something else besides state a fact⟯

#### hereby-criterion

»⟮the hereby-criterion⟯« (used in ⟮＿austin's original distinction＿⟯) ⟮An utterance is ＿performative＿⟯ if ⟮inserting the word hereby into the sentence⟯ ⟮basically preserves the meaning⟯

#### evolution

A sentence can be ⟮both ＿performative＿ and ＿constative＿⟯, which ⟮blows up ＿austin's original distinction＿⟯.

### gricean implicature

»⟮Implicature⟯« (term by ⟮Grice⟯) is ⟮whatever a person meant⟯ ⟮by saying something else⟯.
⟮defeasible⟯ =syn= ⟮cancellable⟯
An ⟮inference (generally an implicature)⟯ is »⟮defeasible⟯« if ⟮it can be erased⟯, e.g. ⟮by saying something contradictory⟯.
⟮＿Implicatures＿⟯ may be ⟮＿conventional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿nonconventional＿⟯.

#### conventional

»⟮A conventional implicature⟯« is ⟮＿an implicature＿⟯ which contains ⟮what a sentence entails⟯ due ot ⟮the conventional meaning of the words involved in the sentence⟯.
^＿The conventional implicature＿ of "The die is green and heavy" is "The die is green" (as well as "The die is heavy")
⟮＿Conventional implicatures＿⟯ are more or less the same as ⟮entailments⟯.

#### nonconventional

»⟮A nonconventional implicature⟯« is ⟮＿an implicature＿⟯ which is ⟮not ＿a conventional implicature＿⟯.

##### conversational

⟮Cooperative Principle⟯ =short=> ⟮CP⟯
»⟮Conversational implicature⟯« is a type of ⟮＿nonconventional impliciature＿⟯ generated by ⟮＿the cooperative principle＿⟯.
»⟮The CP⟯«: "⟮Make your conversational contribution⟯ ⟮such as is required⟯, ⟮at the stage at which it occurs⟯, ⟮by the accepted purpose or direction⟯ ⟮of the talk exchange in which you are engaged⟯."

###### generation via the CP

⟮＿Conversational implicatures＿⟯ are ⟮generated⟯ when the speaker is ⟮presumed to be⟯ ⟮observing the CP and its maxims⟯, and yet they have ⟮said something⟯ that ⟮c_-2;seems to be⟯ ⟮c_-;violating the CP⟯.
The ⟮generation of⟯ ⟮＿conversational implicatures I⎵c⎵＿⟯ may take ⟮3⟯ forms:
1. ⟮supposition of I⎵c⎵⟯ ⟮makes statement actually consistent with the CP⟯, even ⟮though it did not seem so at first⟯.
2. If ⟮the CP wouldn't have been violated⟯ by ⟮violating the Maxim M1⟯, ⟮the maxim M2 would have been⟯. ⟮Ergo we may deduce I⎵c⎵⟯ and ⟮are consistent with the CP⟯
3. the thing the person is saying ⟮could not possibly be consistent with the CP⟯, ergo ⟮we can assume something completely different as I⎵c⎵⟯ and ⟮be consistent with the CP again⟯ (»⟮flouting⟯«)

Via grice's definition, ⟮violating the CP⟯ at ⟮the level of what was said⟯ is ⟮necessary to conversationally implicate⟯.

!One can also ⟮violate the CP⟯ but⟮ not generate ＿conversational implicatures＿⟯ in ⟮two different⟯ ways:
- !⟮indicating one is opting out of the CP⟯
- !not ⟮indicating one is opting out of the CP⟯, yet ⟮not meaning any of the implicatures⟯, thus ⟮misleading the listener (e.g. lying by omission)⟯

###### grice's razor

⟮＿grice's razor＿⟯ is ⟮the motivation⟯ for ⟮positing⟯ ⟮＿conversational implicatures＿⟯ ⟮c-;rather than⟯ ⟮additional senses or different entities⟯.
»⟮Grice's razor⟯«: ceteris paribus it is ⟮better to postulate⟯ ⟮＿conversational implicatures＿⟯ ⟮c-;rather than⟯ ⟮senses (or different entities)⟯ because ⟮they can be derived from⟯ ⟮independently motivated psychosocial principles⟯.

###### maxims

»⟮The four maxims⟯« are what, if followed, make a thing ⟮cooperative in the sense of the CP⟯.
Some ⟮＿maxims＿⟯ are made up of ⟮submaxims⟯.
⟮＿The four maxims＿⟯ are ⟮quantity⟯, ⟮quality⟯, ⟮relation⟯, ⟮manner⟯.


table:maxim|says
»⟮Quantity⟯«|⟮Make your contribution as informative as required⟯
»⟮Quality⟯«|⟮Try to make your contribution one that is true⟯
»⟮Relation⟯«|⟮Be relevant⟯
»⟮Manner⟯«|⟮Be perspicous⟯


Grice does admit that ⟮there might be other maxims (e.g. politeness)⟯ besides his four at work when talking, but says they are not ⟮relevant for generating implicatures to the same extent/in the same way⟯
⟮⊐⊐⟯ sometimes means "⟮is predicted as an implicature by the CP and its maxims⟯"
⟮⊐⟯ sometimes means "⟮implicates⟯"

####### quantity

»A quantity implicature« is ⟮＿a conversational implicature＿⟯ generated by ⟮violating the ＿maxim of quantity＿⟯
»⟮A scalar implicature⟯« is a type of ⟮＿quantity implicature＿⟯ where ⟮a less informative statement⟯ ⟮c-;implicates⟯ ⟮the deinial of a more informative statement⟯, since otherwise ⟮the maxim of quality would have been violated⟯.

######## implicational scale

In the context of ⟮pragmatics⟯, »⟮implicational scale⟯« is ⟮the scales⟯ from ⟮weaker to stronger⟯ statements that are used in ⟮＿quantity implicatures＿⟯

```lang=text;
{all, most, many, some}
{always, often, sometimes}
{succeed in, try to, want to}
{certain, probable, possible}
```
