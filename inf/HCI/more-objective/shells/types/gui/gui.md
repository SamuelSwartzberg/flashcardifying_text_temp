### skeuomorphs and skeuomorphicism

A skeuomorph is a design inspired by a original design which retains elements from the original element that are no longer necessary in the new design, e.g. because it is funcionally different or in a new medium.
Skeuomorphicism is a UI design approach that uses skeuomorphs that imitate real-life objects (though that would no longer be necessary on a digital devices).
