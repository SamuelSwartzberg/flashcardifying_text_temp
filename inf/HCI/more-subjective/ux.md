## waiting

Waiting is less frustrating when there is an indication of progress and transparancy of how the progress relates to the whole (e.g. Kayak.com showing cheaper prices trundling in).
Jason Farman (Delayed Response) argues that what really matters about if we leave a waiting situation satisified is if we waited less than we expected, rather than the whole wait time.
The fact that our expectations are the thing that determines our assesment of waiting and progress bars has given rise to the progress bar that starts out slow and then speeds up towards the end (no matter if this is a correct interpretation)
