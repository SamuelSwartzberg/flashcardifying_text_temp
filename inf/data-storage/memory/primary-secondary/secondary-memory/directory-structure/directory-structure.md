# directory structure

⟮the directory structure⟯ is the way data is organized in a file system using directories.
If the directory structure is a tree, it is often called a/the directory tree.
filesystem hierarchy is a rough synonym of directory structure
In *nix-likes, the root directory is the directory all other directories descend from.
In *nix-likes, since all other directories descend from the root directory, *nix-likes only have a single directory tree.
In *nix-likes, the root directory is `/`
In windowslikes, each partition is its own root directory, with a drive letter assigned.
Windows drive letters have the syntax ‹letter›:
An absolute path begins at the root directory.
A relative path begins at the current working directory.

In general on *nix systems, whatever/share contains architecture-independent data
