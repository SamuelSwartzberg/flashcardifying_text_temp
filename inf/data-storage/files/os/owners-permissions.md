# permissions ＆ owners

The user-and-group model means that for each file every user on the system falls into one of three categories: the owner of the file, someone in the file’s group and everyone else
chown changes the owner and/or group of the file
chown-command ::= {‹option›} [‹owner›][:[‹group›]] {‹file›}
The three permissions that unix tracks are ⟮read⟯, ⟮write⟯,, and ⟮execute⟯
⟮x⟯|⟮execute⟯
⟮w⟯|⟮write⟯
⟮r⟯|⟮read⟯
