## Programming languages I don't know

COBOL is a programming language introduced in 1959 with an englisy-like syntax that is as of 2021 mainly used on ⟮legacy mainframe computers⟯
C was created in 1972.
*nix OSs are famously written in C.
tcl is a programming language where everything is a command.
tcl has a well-known widgeting toolkit known as tk.
wish is a tcl interpreter including its widgeting toolkit tk.

## programming language relationships

### versions over time

Python ⟮2⟯ and ⟮3⟯ have ⟮some syntactic differences.⟯ 
ES2015|ES6
The rust development cycle has the three release channels ⟮Nightly⟯, ⟮Beta⟯ and ⟮Stable::S...⟯. ⟮sb;⟮Every six weeks⟯ ( = ⟮1 cycle⟯), ⟮c+; a release moves up one (beta → stable, nightly → beta) ⟯. ⟯ 
Therefore, ⟮s10:12;⟮what is beta now⟯ will be ⟮stable⟯ in ⟮a maximum of 6 weeks⟯⟯, and ⟮s7:9;⟮what is nightly now⟯ will be ⟮stable⟯ in ⟮at most 12 weeks⟯.⟯ 
⟮Breaking changes (such as reserving new features⟯) can only happen on ⟮the highest rust versioning level⟯, which are ⟮editions⟯. ⟮sb;these are released ⟮about every three years⟯, with the ones in existence as of writing being ⟮2015, 2018, and 2021⟯⟯ 

### dialects, influence, etc.

#### ECMA

JS = Javascript
ES = ECMAScript
JavaScript is a dialect/language that coforms to of the ECMAScript standard
others languages that conform to the ECMAScript standard are ActionScript / JScript. 
However, this distincition is often not made, and JavaScript and ECMAScript are often treated as synonyms. 
CoffeeScript is similar to and compiles down to JavaScript, but has more syntactic sugar/cleaner syntax.
TypeScript is a superset of javascript.

## language governance

After being dropped by mozilla, the rust foundation has taken over the governance of Rust (as of 2021)
The rust foundation is made up of major industry players like microsoft, google, huawei, mozilla.
