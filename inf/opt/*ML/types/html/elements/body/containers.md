# containers

div and span are 'pure' container without any semantics.
the difference between div and span is that div is by default block-level (display: block flow) and that span is by default inline (display: inline flow)

## semantic containers

Some HTML elements are functionally just containers with extra semantics attached (part of semantic html)
HTML element|semantic container for
header|heading-related content
footer|footer
main|
section|generic, but semantically meaningful section
article|self-contained information which could be independently reused
aside|content only indirectly related to main content
address|contact information|may not contain heading/sectioning content
nav|navigation section
