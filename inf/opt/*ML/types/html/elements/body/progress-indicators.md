# progress indicators

A progress bar shows the progress of a task via a bar that becomes fuller as the task nears completion.
In HTML, a progress bar can be indicated by ‹progress›
In HTML, meter generally displays as a bar of varying fullness.
In HTML, meter supposedly represents a scalar value within a known range.
In HTML, progress only accepts max and value as attributes, reflecting the semantics of the completion of a task.
The min and max attributes specify the minimum/maximum value and are allowed on certain types of ‹input›s as well as ‹meter› and max also on ‹progress›
The low, high and optimum attributes may only be specified on ‹meter›
In HTML both progress and meter support a fallback text value within their tags.
