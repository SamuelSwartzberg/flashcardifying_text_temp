# HTML

## general structure

The root element of a HTML document is defined by the `html` element
a ‹html› element consists of a ‹head› element and a ‹body› element

## nesting

some elements must appear as children of other elements - to violate these rules is a violation of good semantics and accessibility, and will hurt your search ranking.
