# cryptanalysis

Cryptanalysis is the part of cryptography concerned with attempts to accesss the contents of encrypted messages.
A cryptanalytic attack is an attempt at cryptanalysis.
Cryptanalytic attacks may be cryptographic algorithm attacks,  side-channel attacks or guessing attacks.
A cryptographic algorithm/side-channel attack is a cryptanalytic attack that exploits a weakness in the algorithm/in the implementation or something else.

## side-channel attack

### communication attack

#### MitM attack

A  ⟮man-in-the-middle⟯ attack is when an attacker ⟮inserts themseves⟯ into the ⟮communication⟯ between ⟮two parties⟯ believing ⟮to be talking to each other directly⟯.

## guessing attack

A guessing attack is a cryptanalytic attack that attempts to try out possible answers until the correct one is reached.
A brute-force/dictionary attack is a guessing attack that tries the entire keyspace/a logically limited keyspace.
