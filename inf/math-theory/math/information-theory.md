## randomness

(C(S))(P)RNG =short for=> (cryptographically (secure)) (pseudorandom) number generator

## symbol rate

baud   Bd
baud   symbol rate (AKA baud rate, modulation rate)
symbol rate   symbol changes per second

## coding theory

The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol (of the alphabet used).
This means that the hammming weight of a binary number is its digit sum. 
The hamming weight of 11101 is 4, the hamming weight of 60801 is 3
