## Computer vision

⟮Computer vision (CV)⟯ is a field of study that aims to get ⟮artificial systems / AI⟯ to get ⟮meaningful information / understanding⟯ from ⟮digital images/videos/whatever⟯.

### depth

⟮Stereopsis}/{{c2::stereo(scopic) vision⟯ is ⟮the ability to percieve depth⟯ from ⟮only two eyes/optical sensors⟯.
binocular disparity is the difference between the images that the optical sensors involved in stereopsis recieve due to them being positioned somewhat apart.
stereo matching is matching the two images produced by stereopsis.
After stereo matching, one can calculate the distance via trangulation.
stereo matching is more difficult (esp. for computer sensors) if the thing is featureless (since it then has a harder time matching the relevant pixels)
To improve stereo matching on featureless things, a device intended for depth calculation via stereopsis often will project a IR dot pattern, which is a pseudorandom but known pattern of dots in the infrared spectrum, which it then can use as the things to match.

### triangulation

⟮Triangulation⟯ in surveying / computer vision / etc. is ⟮determining the location⟯ of ⟮a point C⟯ from ⟮two points A and B⟯ by ⟮forming a triangle⟯.
By knowing the ⟮distance between A and B⟯ as well as ⟮the angles at A and B⟯, we can ⟮reconstruct the distance.⟯

## safety

### technological singularity

The technological singularity is a hypothetical point at which technological progress reaches critical mass and becomes uncontrollable, causing severe but unpredictable changes.
Most commonly, the technological singularity is cashed out in terms of a intelligence explosion.
An intelligence explosion posits that there willl be a runaway reaction of self-improvement cycles of an AI, thereby bringing about the technological singularity.

# software engineering

Software engineering is term where the definition is often fought over.
Software engineering (roughly) is different from software development/programming in that it emphasizes a more holistic view including tools and processes used for development, and temporally not just the time writing code, but the time before and after too.
