# data types

## basics

Data type is ambiguous between abstract data type and concrete data type
An abstract data type is a subset of all possible values, and a specification of their behavior.
A concrete data type is an abstract data type together with the method of its implementation.
A value is an element of the set of all possible values.

## primitive vs. composite

A primitive/composite data type⎵compositionality⎵ does not consist of/consists of other data types.
An primitive/composite abstract・concrete data type⎵compositionality⎵ is a primitive/composite data type⎵compositionality⎵ where the data types in question are abstract・concrete data types.

## subsets

A supertype/subtype is a data type whose possible values are a superset/subset of those of another data type.
