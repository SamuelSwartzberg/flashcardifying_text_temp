A shell is a wrapper around the OS that acts as an interface between it and humans.
Types of shells: graphical, command-based
Shell is often but kinda incorrectly used as a synonym to command-based shell
A TUI is a user interface that uses Text to render, but accept input like GUIs, and like GUIs they consume a fixed part of the screen.
NUIs are (mostly theoretical/hypothesized) intefaces that are claimed to be natural to use in some way.

UI|User interface
NUI|natural user inteface
GUI|graphical user interface
TUI|Text-based user interface
CLI|Command-line interface
