## robots/noindex

There are two ways to ⟮specify what crawlers such as those from search engines can crawl⟯, ⟮the robots.txt⟯ and ⟮the noindex tag⟯. 
The ⟮robots.txt⟯ follows/implements ⟮the robots exclusion standard/protocol⟯. 
⟮The robots.txt⟯ is a file with ⟮a specific syntax⟯ to indicate ⟮what can crawl sites how⟯. 
⟮The robots.txt⟯ may not ⟮always hide pages⟯, specifically, ⟮the page may still display in search results⟯, but ⟮lacking any descriptive content⟯. If you want ⟮to hide the page completely⟯, use ⟮a noindex tag or HTTP header⟯. 
The ⟮noindex tag⟯ is a ⟮HTML meta tag⟯ that ⟮tells crawlers how they should crawl the given page⟯. 
Setting both ⟮the robots.txt⟯ and ⟮noindex tag⟯ for the same thing ⟮can produce problems⟯ and ⟮is not advised⟯. 
While ⟮you can tell what crawlers should crawl⟯ via ⟮robots.txt/noindex⟯, ⟮there is no reason they have to respect it.⟯ 
⟮Pages that should be on the robots.txt/have a noindex tag⟯ are e.g. ⟮internal search pages, pages that require a certain state.⟯ 
If ⟮a page should truly inaccessible to outside forces⟯, ⟮using robots.txt/noindex tags is not enough⟯, it should then be ⟮password-protected or similar.⟯ 
Example noindex tag: `‹⟮meta⟯ name="⟮robots⟯ (all) / ⟮googlebot⟯ (only google) content="⟮noindex⟯"›` 

## sitemap

sitemaps are XML, RSS/Atom, or .txt documents that describe the navigational structure of your site, and are often used by search engines

## search

The most fundamental thing that influences your SEO is how many other links to your site exist, and who these sites linking to you are.
By linking to a site, you confer some of your sites reputation to that site.

related to navigation, google will reward a site that has a navigation that is ⟮sensible⟯, uses ⟮text (or e.g. aria tags)⟯, but ⟮does not go overboard in its complexity⟯
Google may penalize if you have a bunch of pages with basically the same content.

As of 2021, ⟮stuffing keywords⟯ in places is ⟮no longer effective⟯ for ⟮SEO⟯ 
As of 2021, for ⟮SEO⟯, ⟮a page title/ description⟯ should be ⟮descriptive of the page content⟯ and ⟮distinct from other page titles⟯.
