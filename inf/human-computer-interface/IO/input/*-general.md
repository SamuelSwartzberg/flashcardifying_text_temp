## modes

### basics

A mode⎵wide⎵ is a mode⎵narrow⎵ or a quasimode.
A mode⎵narrow⎵ is a state which is explictly entered and exited where the same input will produce different results than if it wasn't in that state.
A quasimode is like a mode, but the state is only maintained as long as an action is performed.

### mode errors

Modes are prone to mode errors.
A mode error occurs when a user tries to do an action only appropriate for a different mode and gets an undesired response.
mode errors occur because the user lacks understanding between the difference in modes, has not (yet) recieved the indication of a mode switch, or is confused/has forgotten about the active mode.
Focus stealing is a mode error that happens when a program unexpectedly has focus, and the user attempts actions for the other program.
