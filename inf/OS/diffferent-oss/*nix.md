## what's in a *nix

### GNU/Linux

GNU is the set of free software that accompanies the linux kernel in GNU/Linux.
GNU = GNU's not unix
The GPL was originally created for GNU
(GNU) GPL = GNU General Public License
Linux technically refers to the Linux kernel.
GNU software set + Linux kernel = GNU/Linux
Often, Linux alone is used (technically incorrectly) to refer to GNU/LInyx

A Linux distribution is GNU/Linux plus a set of other stuff, which depends on the flavor.

Android uses the Linux Kernel but not GNU or any of the other libraries.
From ⟮android⟯ ⟮1.0⟯ until ⟮9⟯, ⟮android⟯ versions had ⟮sweets⟯-based names, with each name ⟮going one further in the alphabet⟯

#### WSL

WSL = Windows Subsystem for Linux
The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a Linux VM/compatibility layer for Windows
The Windows Subsystem for Linux allows you to do things like run a shell environment of linux on windows, and even X11 applications
To install the Windows Subsystem for linux, turn it on in the "Turn windows features on or off" dialog, then download the distro from the windows store
The windows drives with letters C, D, ... are accesible from the WSL as /mnt/c, /mnt/d ...

### Android

⟮Android features⟯ depend on the relevant ⟮API level⟯, which starts at ⟮1⟯ and is at ⟮30⟯ as of android ⟮11⟯ 

Curreny android has one ⟮API level⟯ per ⟮major version⟯ (e.g. ⟮android 11⟯), but it used to be ⟮multiple ones per version⟯ (bc in the past ⟮minor versions⟯, e.g. ⟮2.2.⟯ Gingerbread and even ⟮patch versions⟯, e.g. ⟮2.2.3⟯ Gingerbread ⟮introduced new features⟯)
