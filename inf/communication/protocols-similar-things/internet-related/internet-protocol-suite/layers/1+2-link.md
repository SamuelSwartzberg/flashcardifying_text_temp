# layer 2 ＆ 1 (TCP/IP Link layer)

NIC = Network interface controller
A NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer to a computer network (layer 1 ＆ 2 (physical and data link))
MAC addresses identify NICs uniquely.
MAC addresses are 48 bit long.
MAC address = media access control address
Mac addresses are most commonly used with IEEE 802 technologies.

## IEE 802

IEEE 802 networking technologies contain technologies such as bluetooth (formerly, now managed/standartized by the bluetooth special interest group), ethernet, and WLAN
IEEE 802.3|Ethernet
IEEE 802.11|WLAN/WIFI

### WLAN

WLAN may run in ⟮infrastructure⟯ or ⟮ad-hoc mode⟯
(WLAN) In infrastructure mode, clients connect to  ⟮a central WAP (Wireless Access Point)⟯
(WLAN) In ad-hoc network mode, clients connect ⟮to each other peer to peer⟯

### Ethernet

The ethernet frame header contains quite a few fields, amonst which the most important might be destination MAC address and source mac address

IPoE is short for IP over Ethernet
PPPoE is short for Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet
