# networks

A network is a group of connected nodes that communicate via a medium, and almost always via a protocol.


## routing

Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. 

### addresses

An address is the identifier of an entity(ies) in a network, often relevant to a specific protocol.
A broadcast address is an address that identifies a subgroup of entities to target with a broacast transmission.
Loopback is the routing of signals/streams back to their source without intentional processing/modification.

## topologies

The topology of a network is how its vertices are arranged.
A tree network may consist of star networks connected ⟮via a bus network⟯, or may be a tree just as a network.
In a bus, everyone attached recieves the transmission.
In a bus, only one entity can send at a time.
Sometimes, bus is used to refer any connection between two points, even if it isn't a bus (this definition is nonsense)
A daisy chain is a topology where devices are linked in a line or ring.
