## clients

A thin client is a low-performance computer that mainly exists to connect with a server, which handles most of the computing ï¼† storage.
A zero client is a thin client driven to extremes, so that it has no local storage and barely any computing ability of its own.
Hardware terminals are basically zero clients.
a rich/fat/heavy/thick client is a client that contrasts with a thin client in that it can do more stuff itself.
