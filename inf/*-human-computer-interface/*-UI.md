# UI

UI =short for=> User Interface

A user interface is a human-computer interface from the perspective of seeing it as a holistic thing.

## properties

### interaction styles

#### basics

An interaction style is a way of interacting with a user interface.
Direct manipulation is an interaction style that involves continuous representation and rapid, reversible and incremental feedback.
^sometimes known as visual representation
Menu input is an interaction style that involves using menus.
Fill-in-the-blanks is an interaction style that involves entering data into places where prompted.
Command-based input is an interaction style that involves inputting commands & submitting and recieving output.
^Usually confusingly called command-based interface or command language

#### command-based input

Command-based input comes in two main flavors, argument-based and sentence-based.
Argument-based/sentence-based command-based input is command-based input where additional information is given via arbitrarily ordered arguments / via a syntax of word-like things.

##### sentence-based

The sentence-based command syntax is the syntax of sentence-based command-based input.
Object/verb-first sentence-based command syntax is ‹addressee› ‹object› ‹verb›/‹verb› ‹object› {‹objects›}.
Object-first sentence-based command syntaxes: gh, nmcli

### manner of rendering

(solely) text/graphics-rendering is the property of an user interface of (solely) using text/graphics to render.

### ability to display

Graphics-using is the property of an user interface of being able to display graphics of some sort, which is true for all UI types I know of.

## types

A UI type is a type of UI.


table:UI type|interaction style|manner of rendering
GUI|all except command-based|text & graphics-rendering
TUI|all except direct manipulation & command-based|text-rendering (mostly)
CLI|all except direct manipulation, though command-based is primary|text-rendering (mostly)

## shells

A shell is UI that is a wrapper around the OS. 
A command-line/graphical/text shell is a shell that is a CLI/GUI/TUI.

## other paradigms
