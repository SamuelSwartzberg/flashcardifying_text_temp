# grammar (supercategory of all of this)

Most broadly, grammar is the sets of rules governing a languoid.
A reference work on the grammar of a language may also be known as a grammar, more precisely as a reference grammar.
If a string conforms to the grammar of a lect, it is called grammatical.
A grammaticality judgement is a judgement on the gramatticality of a string by a certain speaker.
grammaticality judgements are often used as linguistic evidence, generative grammar also aims to predict them.
* marks a thing that is ungrammatical.
In linguistics, an empty category is an element in the study of syntax that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.
An empty category = something unpronounced is often indicated by ø or ＊e＊
In linguistics, a string is a sequence of words/sounds that we don't want to put any deeper analytical category on just yet.

# syntax

Syntax is the study of how words and morphemes form larger units such as phrases and sentences.
Morphosyntax is where morphology and syntax interset.

## Information structure

Information structure is the subfield of linguistics describing how information is organized within a sentence.
Information structure mainly consists of the three oppoositions of focus/background, topic/comment, and givenness/new

## Expletives

An ⟮expletive⟯ is a ⟮meaningless⟯ element put in some position to ⟮fulfil a grammatical requirement⟯. (Can also mean profanity, of course)
Often words used as expletives also have other functions with more semantic content, however this semantic content is discarded when used as an expletive.
E.g. ⁑There⁑ is someone helping us here. ⁑It⁑ was raining, wasn't ⁑it⁑?

## Grammatical relations

Grammatical relations are subjects and objects, and perhaps others depending on your theory.
Grammatical relations are different things to different theorists.
The generative grammar/chomskyan approach is to see an object as the DP complement of a verb.

## labelled bracket

Labeled bracketing notation can generate an arbitrary tree, but is mostly used to generate syntax trees.
Labeled bracketing notation: tree ::= \[‹nodename {‹tree›|‹leaf›}
leaf ::= #somestring

## frameworks

Syntax is a field where there are a bunch of frameworks or theories of how it works, but not much agreement.
Generative semantics was a response to generative grammar developed in the 1960s.
The conflict between propoonents of generative grammar and generative semantics was known as the linguistics wars.
The proponents of generative semantics in the linguistics wars called themselves ⟮the four horsemen of the apocalypse⟯, amongst which was george lakoff
Generative semantics held that syntactic structures from meanings, rather than the other way around

## constituents

A constituent is a word or group of words that functions together as a single unit and has hierarchical structure.
The assembly of constitutents into larger constituents allows the generation the infinite variety of possible sentences that language is famous for.
Phrases are constituents, but not all constituents are phrases.
Constituents are identified by using constituent tests.
There are many constituent tests in english, among which are: proform substitution
proform test: Substitute the relevant proform, perform a grammaticality judgement
```lang=text;
The lady running the group handed in her resignation at noon.
The lady running the group did so at noon.
```
cleft test: Move the string into the main clause of a cleft sentence (It was/is x that...)
```lang=text;
The guests from overseas visited the best parts of the city on Monday
It was the best parts of the city that the guests from overseas visited on Monday.
```
question test: Ask for the string in question with a wh-question.
```lang=text;
The lady running the group handed in her resignation at noon.
What did the lady running the group hand in at noon?
Her resignation.
```
Movement test: move string to different position in sentence.
```lang=text;
Gertrude wasn't interested in art.
Interested in art, Gertrude wasn't.
```

## phrasees

a phrase is a constituent which acts a certain way related to other constituents and has a certain internal structure relative to its type.
The head of a phrase is the thing everything else in the phrase is about.
In a phrase, everything that isn't the head is a dependent.
In head-inital/head-final languages, the head comes at the beginning/end of the phrase, respectively
head-initial|English (partially)

### X-bar framework-based


The X-bar theory asserts that all phrases have the structure ✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png/300px-X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png✫, which is called the X-bar schema.
In the X-bar theory, each node is binary, i.e. has two children.
In the X-bar theory, each phrase has a head.
in the X-bar schema, there are four types of components in each schema.
In the X-bar schema, arguments are necessary but may be empty.
In the X-bar schema, the two types of arguments are complements and specifiers
The difference between complements and specifiers is that the complement is a sister node to X, while the specifier is a sister node to X'.
In the X-bar schema, anything that is not a head or an argument is an adjunct.
Adjuncts may also be called modifiers.
Adjuncts are optional, and adjoining them creates a phrase of the same type as it originally was.
Ergo adjoining something to a YP results in a larger YP.
Adjunction can be recursive.
An adjunct can be any type of phrase.

In the X-bar schema, XP is theoretically X''.
In the X-bar schema, X' and X'' (XP) are projections of X.

In the X-bar schema, to indicate that foo is both a head and a complete phrase (both the minimal and the maximal projection), you can

X/XP
foo

X(P)
foo

XP

X'

X

XP
|
X
foo

In the X-bar framework, a phrase consists

CP

[CP [C] [IP]]
CP may either be complement or adjunct to verb/VP
to test whether a CP is an adjunct or a complement, use a proform test on the Verb/VP without the CP.

The object is the thing that is the complement of the VP.

#### IPs

under the IP theory, the sentence is an IP headed by an I.
The argument for I as the head of the sentence goes something like: It makes sense for a sentence to be a type of phrase and has a head, inflectional information is core to a sentence, so it makes sense for that to be the head.
in the IP theory, I stands for inflection.
under the IP theory, the subject is the thing that is in the specifier of the IP.
under the IP theory, the complement of I is the VP.

class=inner;|class=inner;⟮I⟯|class=inner;⟮VP⟯
class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin



#### VP-internal subject hypothesis

According to the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject DP starts out in the VP, and them moves to the specifier of the IP later.
According to the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject DP will not move from the specifier of the VP to the specifier of the IP if the specifier of the IP is already filled by an expletive subject.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it makes the VP consistent with the X-bar schema.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it makes the subject which is semantically an argument of the V also grammatically an argument of the V.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it lets us address some discontinuities, especially in relation to adverbs.
Evidence: The subject is an argument of the V, but it appears outside of the VP, closer to I than to V.

#### DP hypothesis: 

The DP hypothesis claims that what are commonly assumed to be NPs are actuall DPs headed by a D.
The DP hypothesis argues that D can be seen as the head of a DP since the D picks out the referent, and everything, including the noun, then merely describes the D.
Intuitively, the head of "the best student of physics" seems to be "student", but the DP hypothesis claims its "the".
Part of the motivation for the DP hypothesis is that pronouns seem to be NPs without an actual N head.
The DP hypothesis is still a controversial hypothesis
The DP hypothesis often correlates with the idea that pronouns are determiners.
In the DP hypothesis, a determinerless noun has a silent/unpronounced D.

#### IP hypothesis

Auxiliaries actually start out as V, and then the top one (in the tree) moves to I.
Multiple auxiliaries are adjoined as Vs to the VP.
Assuming multiple auxiliaries as part of one I head does not work, as we can insert things such as adverbs between them.

#### early modern english

Lexical verbs could move to I, and thus to C, following the HMC.
In current english, wh-questions need do-support since something needs to fill the C position, and the verb can't, since it can't move to I.
In early modern english, wh-questions did not need do-support since the V could move to I and thus to C.
"What heards't thou?"

#### german sentences

The german main clause V2, subordinate clause V-final constituent order is explained as follows:
In german, VP and IP are head-filnal
All german clauses are CPs with pronouced Cs.
Subordinate german clauses have their C positions filled by a complementizer as usual.
If C is not filled by a complementizer (mostly main clauses), then V moves to I and then to C.
In german subordinate clauses, the V can't move to C, because that is typically already filled by a real complementizer.
If in german the V position is occupied by a compound verb, if the V moves (via I to C), what moves is the root, leaving the affix behind.
Main clauses in german have the specifier of C filled by an arbitrary constituent moving there.

### types of phrases

The type of phrase a phrase is (AdvP, VP, NP...) is called phrasal category.
An XP is a phrase with X as its head.

## clauses

A clause links a predicand (expressed or not) with a predicate.

<div class="c1-f">
Under the more wide definition, what is the predicate here?
</div>
<div class="c1-f">
Under the more narrow definition, what is the predicate here?
</div>
<div class="c1-f">
How are these often called in short?
</div><br><pre><code data-codetype="text">Bill heard Fred</code></pre> <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::heard Fread.}}
<pre><code data-codetype="text">Bill heard Fred</code></pre> <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::heard}}
In grammar, a predicate either connects the subject to an idea ('what the subject is like'), or is...? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::something that says something about a subject}}
In grammar, a predicate is either the thing that says something about the subject, or the thing that connects what to what? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::the subject to an idea ('what the subject is like')}}
In grammar, a predicate is either the thing that says something about the subject, or what, in relation to the the subject and an idea ('what the subject is like')? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::It connects the subject to an idea ('what the subject is like')}}
In grammar, either (a) something that says something about a subject or (b) something that links something a subject and what that subject is like is called... <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::a predicate}}
In grammar, what is the problem with the term predicate? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::It has two competing definitions}}


A clause is a type of constituent.

In linguistic typology, a null-subject language is a language whose grammar permits an independent clause to lack an explicit subject; such a clause is then said to have a null subject.
An independent clause always features a subjecti or has a null subject.
Languages I speak that are null-subject languages are spanish and japanese.

Subordinate clause = dependent clause
A subordinate/dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence.
Independent clause = main clause ≈ root clause ≈ matrix clause
A independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

### subordinate clauses

An embedded question is a question that is a subordinate clause.
As CPs generally are, embedded questions are adjuncts of the VP or complements of the verb (in japanese too)

#### relative clause

A relative clause is a subordinate clause that describes a DP/NP
A ⟮relative clause⟯ is a ⟮subordinate clause⟯ which generally ⟮describes the referent of its head⟯.
I met a furry who was passionate.
In indo-european languages, a relative clause is generally introduced by a relative pronoun.

### interrogative

In syntax, an interrogative clause has a particular type of syntax and/or prosoody, which is typically used to ask question (attach the illocutionary act/force of asking a question).
Languages may have diffrent types of interrogative clauses (i.e. different syntaxes used to ask different types of questions).
A question iteself is an illocutionary act/force seeking to obtain an answer.
In many languages, besides syntax/prosody, written exchanges often indicate interrogatives by special punctuation.

If syntax is used to indicate an interrogative, it may be in the form of conjugating the verb, changing the word order, adding interrogative words, particles, or other constituents, or often a combination of these.

#### conjugation

#### word order

##### I-to-C movement

In english, wh-questions and yes/no questions alike are marked by I-to-C movement.
In english interrogatives that are not subject questions, the sentence becomes a CP.
In english interrogatives, the newly formed C position is filled by I moving to C.
In english interrogatives, if there is no I to move to C, I is made pronounced via do-support.

##### wh-movement

A wh-question is a interrogative sentence using a wh-word.
Wh-questions typically feature wh-movement.
wh-movement is a form of head movement.
The wh-constituent moves from and therefore its trace is to be found in where it would be in an answer to the question, unless it is in situ.
A wh in situ question is a wh-question where the wh-prhase does not move.
She was reading what? They went where? She spoke to who(m)?
A subject question in english is where the wh-phrase is the subject of the sentence.
Of the wh-questions, subject questions are the only ones that don't feature I to C movement, and thus also no do-support.
the syntax of a subject question has the same syntax as a statement.

Places out of which constituents for wh-questions are impossible to extract   islands
There are a bunch of islands:
- No extraction of one of the conjuncts of a coordinated phrase.
- No extraction out of a CP inside a DP
- No extraction out of a subject (for most English speakers)
- No extraction out of adjuncts
Besides out of islands, wh-movement will be ungrammatical if it does not comply with the shortest move / minimal link condition: The move must be the shortest possible = there must not be a wh-element that would have to move less far.

#### adding constituents

##### tag questsions

A tag question is an interrogative clause which is formed from a declarative clause plus a question tag.
A question tag is an interrogative fragment.
Most languages have an (or multiple) simple question tag(s) allowing for tag question formation.
question tags come in two basic flavors, asking one to confirm or asking one to deny.
Examples of question tags:
en|right?|no?, or no?
de|stimmts?, gell?, wa?, ne?|nicht wahr?, oder nicht?
es|verdad?|no?
English as well as some other languages allow  to the end of a declarative clause to turn it into an interrogative clause.
English as welll as a few other languages have specific grammar for forming more complex tag question fragments, in english: aux + pronoun

##### interrogative words ＆ particles

In english, interrogative words start with wh- and are thus known as wh-words.


### ordination

Coordination/subordination may imply different semantic relationships between the conjuncts.
illative|presents a consequence
cumulative|adds more
adversative|introduces a contrast
disjunctive|selfexpl.

causal|presents a reason
purposive|
conditional|
concessional|
comparative|
temporal|

In english, coordination/subordination is most often performed by conjunctions.

#### coordination

Coordination is the process of linking two things of the same type.
The two things linked via coordination are called conjuncts.
The totality of coordinator(s) and conjuncts forming an instance of coordination is called a coordinate structure.

#### subordination

Subordination is linking two things (maincly clauses), where one depends on the other.
A complement clause is an argument of a predicate.
A complementizer turns a clause into 
A complementizer turns a clause into the subject or object of a sentence.
In english, the complementizer 'that' sometimes is unpronounced
Akane thought that Lilly was a いい子. ⇒ Akane thought Lilly was a いい子. 

## sentences

A sentence consists of one or more clausees.
A simple sentence consists of one (main/independent) clause.
A complex sentence consists of at least one main/independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
A sentence is a constituent cannot be further joined into larger constituents.
A major sentence we might consider a 'normal sentence' following the usual syntactic rules etc.
A minor sentence is a sentence without the usual subject-predicate/constituent structure.
Minor sentences generally do not allow substitution of items of the same word class: Merry Christmas!; *Merry Birthday!
A sentence word (also called a one-word sentence) is a single word that forms a full sentence.

A cleft sentence splits a simple sentence up into a complex sentence. 
Cleft seentence typically put the constituent now in the independent clause into focus.
Syntax of cleft sentences in english: it + conjugated form of to be + X + subordinate clause

## movement

discontinuity is the phenomenon where a constituent is split into two parts ⟮due to the insertion of an element which is not part of it⟯
Syntactic movement is the means by which some theories of syntax address discontinuities.
Two types of movement often distinguished are phrasal and head movement.
In phrasal movement, an entire phrase moves.
In head movement is when only a head of a phrase moves, leaving its dependents behind.

In chomskyian theories, movement leaves behind an empty category called a trace.
Traces are indicated by t and subscripted with a letter or  number indicating what moved, this is known as coindexing.
Some of the evidence of traces is that we can't contract over them.

In syntax, something is "in situ" if it doesn't move, although it normally would.

### head movement 

The Head Movement Constraint (HMC) is the rule that a head H can only move to a position occupied by the head which selects HP as its complement.
Due to the HMC, the only way a constiutent can move to a position that isn't selecting HP as its complement is via stepwise movement.
The head movement contraint only applies to head movement, obv.
According to the HMC, I can only move to a position that sellects IP as its complement.
If english lexical verbs wanted to move to C in y/n questions, it would have to move to I first.

#### prepositions

When the object of a transitive preposition moves, what may happen to the prepostion is either preposition stranding or pied piping.
An entire expression moves, instead of leaving something behind   Pied Piping
A head moves and leaves behind a preposition   Preposition stranding


## parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar grammatical properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Part of speech may be synonymous with lexcial category if we don't acknowledge functional categories.
a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members
Clear distingction of word classes are difficult across languages.
Often the things we think of a ertain word class doing is actually what a phrase headed by that thing does.

A|Adjective
P|Adposition
Adv|Adverb
Comp|coordinating conjunction
D|Determiner
N|Noun
V|Verb

esp. in generative grammar, functional and lexical categories are often distinguished.
functional category|purely grammatical meaning|Det, Conj, Aux...
lexical category|some sort of semanting content|V, N, A, Adv...

A word that is a member of a functional category is called a function word.
A word that is a member of a lexical category is called a content word.

### particle

A particle is a function word (member of a functional category) which cannot be inflected.
A particle occurring at the end of the sentence is a sentence-final particle.
Particles do not refer.
Sentence-final particles in particular generally indicate modality, register or other pragmatic effects.

### Interjections

An interjection is a lexical item that indicates a reaction. 
Interjections are pretty separated from the rest of the syntax of the sentence.
Interjections are a syntactic category, while discourse marker is a pragmatic category.

### adjective

An adjective (phrase) describes a thing or restricts its referent.
Adjective phrases in english can exist syyntactically in three ways: an attributive adjective, a predicative adjective and a nominalized adjective.
An attributive adjective phrase is adjoined to an NP.
A predicative adjective phrase has the adjective phrase as the complement of the verb.
A nominalized adjective works as the head of an NP.

### adverb

In english at least, adverb(ial) phrases (and thus adverbs) act as a modifier/adjunct for any number of phrases, but not NPs (which is instead handled by APs).
Adverbial phrases describes the thing its modifying.
Adverbs/adverbial phrases are at least able to modify other AdvPs, APs, DPs, PPs, VPs, and IPs.

### noun

Nouns are heads of NPs.
NPs (no DP theory) matter because they are the things that can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions.
If we believe in the DP theory, NPs matter because they are the complements of Ds, and DPs are the things that can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions.

#### attribution

In grammar, something attributive is a phrase within a NP/DP that modifies the head noun. 
Adnnominal seems to be a synonym for attributive
In english, relative clauses and attributive adjectives are the main things that act attributively.
A verb that can be used attributively is known as an attributive verb.

### det

A determiner is a word/affix that occurs that occurs together with a NP and expresses something about the reference of the noun phrase.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner
Types of determiners: Articles, Demonstrative determiners, Quantifiers, distributive determiners, interrogative determiners

#### Quantifier

Quantifiers are a type of determiner/pronoun (which may depending on your analysis may be a quantifier too).
quantifiers are adjoined to the DP/NP to form a larger DP/NP.
table:span=2;⟮DP⟯
⟮Q/D⟯|⟮DP⟯
all|the students

Floating quantifier is a quantifier that is not immediately near the NP/DP it quantifies.
According to the VP-int-subj-hyp, floating quantifiers happen because of the two DPs that could move to the subject position in the specifier position of the IP, the smaller DP moves, leaving the quantifier behind.
The existence of floating quantifiers provides evidence for the VP-internal subject hypothesis by explainin why the quantifier is in this position.

#### Articles

Examples of Articles in EN: the, an, a

#### posessive determiners

my, your, his, her, its, our, their

### adpositions

An adposition may either be a preposition, circumposition or a postposition.
semantically, adpositions may be temporal adpositions, spatial adpositions, or adpositions that mark a different semantic/thematic role.
Adpositions may be transitive or intransitive.
Intransitive adpositions are often called adverbs, though that's probably an inferior analysis.
Intransitive adposition examples: here/everywhere/downstairs/ahead/outside/...
Transitive adpositions may take other adpositions as complements.

### conj

Conjunctions either perform coordination or subordination.

### proforms

Proforms are function words that stand in for another constituent.
DP/NP|Pronouns
NP/N'|one
Verb|do (so)
Temporal adposition|then
Spatial adposition|there
other adposition|none exists

#### pronouns

Pronouns are proforms that stand for NPs, or DPs if we believe in them, not for nouns themselves.

A pro-drop language is a language where certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically or grammatically inferable. 
Japanese and Spanish are pro-drop, German and English are, with rare exceptions, not.

##### personal

Personal pronouns are pronouns that are associated primarily with a particular grammatical person.


### copula (and existential verbs)

A copula is a word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to its complement/predicate.
The tree ☞is☜ blue.
Depending on the language, a copula may or may not be a verb.
An existential verb indicates the existence of something.
In some languages the copula and the main existential verb are the same, of those I speak, only english: to be (The chair is green, there is a god)
In some languages the copula and the main existential verb are different:
es|ser/estar|haber
de|sein|geben
ja|だ|ある・いる

Some languages distinguish different existential verbs for different semantic categories.
Japanese distinguishes its existential verbs ある・いる along a inanimate/animate distinction.

### verbs

#### dynstat

Dynamic and static verbs are often contrasted.
A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action.
A stative (unclear relation to stative aspect) verb is a verb that descirbes a state.
setzen is a dynamic verb while sitzen is a dynamic verb.

#### aux

Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
In English, sentences without auxiliars cannot have negation.
In English, auxiliaries cannot take an object (complement of the VP), while lexical verbs can.
Auxiliary verbs are members of the functional category, while lexical verbs are members of the lexical category.
In English, auxiliaries go before the subject DP/NP in question inversion.
have and do may or may not be auxiliary verbs.
dummy do is do used as an auxiliary verb.
using dummy do is called do-support
do-support is used when an axuliary verb is syntactically required but none is present.

### changing parts of speech

#### nominalization

Nominalization is the process of treating / transforming something which is not a noun as / into a noun / head of an NP.
A nominalizer is a thing, usually a bound morpheme, that nominalizes a thing.

## word order

Word order is how a language orders the syntacic constituents of a language.
Word order may be a distinguishing characteristic in linguistic typology.
Even languages which typically allow large amounts of flexibility in word order (e.g. by marking case) generally have a typical word order, where having a different order is considered marked. (see: Japanese)

### constituent order

the constituent order of a clause, namely the relative order of subject, object, and verb, is one way to distinguish word order.
German has verb-second constituent order in main clauses and verb-final constituent order in subordinate clauses.
SOV, SVO, etc

Verb-final language place the verb at the end of a clause.
Completely verb-final: japanese

V2 word order is that the verb comes in the second syntactically relevant place of the sentence, and the first can be filled by a variety of different constituents.
In V2 word order, the first constituent functions as the topic.

A linguistic universal is a pattern that occurs systematically across (most often all) natural languages.


# grammatical feature

A grammatical feature is more rarely called grammatical category.
A grammatical feature is a property of items within the grammar of a language. 
Within each grammatical feature there are two or more possible values (sometimes called grammemes), which are normally mutually exclusive.

## phi-features (noun-related)

phi-features is a group of grammatical features related to nouns.
Phi-features include person, number, gender and case

### noun class

Grammatical gender is a form of noun-class system.

### number

Grammatical number is a grammatical feature distinguising amounts.
Grammatical number is most often marked on things present in the DP/NP (Determiners, Nouns, Adjectives) and via verbal agreement.
As regars grammatical number, most languages have a singular/plural distinction.
In languages with a singular/plural distinction, the singular refers to one entity, and the plural refers to more than one entity.
In languages with a singular/plural distinction, most often the singular is the unmarked form, and the plural is marked.
Some languages have a singulative/collective distinction.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the collective refers to the item with no distinction into individual entities, and the singulative refers to a specific entity.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the collective form is generally the unmarked one, while the singulative form is marked.
English, German and Spanish have grammatical number that distinguishes Singular and Plural, Japanese does not have grammatical number.

Other grammatical numbers:
Dual|two
Trial|three
Paucal|a few

### case

Grammatical case is a grammatical feature marking thematic relation or grammatical relation/morphosyntactic alignment.
Grammatical case is mostly marked on things within the DP/NP.

Accusative   object of a verb
Nominative   Subject of a verb

Dative case is sometimes said to mark the indirect object, but the indirect object is just an english construct for describing a certain kind of object of a verb. in this sense, many cases mark something that is an object or at least argument of a verb, not just dative.
Dative indicates recipient or benificiary of an action.
Lative case indicates a movement to a location.
Ablative case indicates a movement away from a location.
Locative case indicates a location.
benefactive case indicates that something is done for the benefit someone/is intended for someone.
Benefactive case is often included in the dative case.
Terminative/terminalis case specifies a limit in space/time and/or the goal/target of an action.
Genitive   posess⁑or⁑
Instrumental   A means or tool used or companion present in/while performing an action	
Abessive/caritive/privative absence of the thing.
Comitative accompaniment
Ornative endowed with, supplied with
In english, the word with performs the function of both comitative and instrumental cases, this case is sometimes called the instrumental-comitative case..
Prolative/vialis/prosecutive/traversal/mediative by way of, via
Inessive within
Illative into
Elative out of
In elative "from inside"
Superessive on top of, on the surface of.
subessive below
perlative through, across, along
Vocative   adressee
Exessive away from a state
Egressive beginning of a movement from a location or time ('starting from')
Identical something is identical to another
Equative something is the same value as another
Comparative something is like something (e.g. cold as ice)
Translative case becoming X, changing to X
Pertingent case touching x
Intrative case "amidst"

## honorific

A honorific is a grammatical feature that encodes social relationships.
Honorifics may encode formality, social distance, politeness, humillity, deference, or respect, depending on the language.
Honorifics may be encoded via a variety of linguistic devices.

### T-V

The T-V distinction is a honorific distinction encoded in pronouns.
The T-V distinction is sometimes understood more narrowly as a honorific distinction encoded in two different second-person pronouns.
The T-V distinction is common in many Indo-European languages, but not english.
The name T-V distinction comes from latin tu/vos.

## polarity

Polarity is a grammatical feature that encodes the difference between validity/truth/confirmation (positive polarity) and falsity/denial (negative polarity).
Positive polarity = affirmation
Negative polarity = negation

## others



## mainly related to verbs

### grammatical person

⟮Grammatical person⟯ is personal deixis encoded in language.
It is frequently realized in ⟮personal pronouns⟯ and ⟮verbs⟯ (but sometimes also in other places).
Most languages distinguish three forms of grammatical person.

First person|The speaker
Second person|The addressee
Third person|neither speaker nor addressee

### grammatical voice

Voice is a grammatical feature, mainly of verbs/VPs, that maps semantic roles over grammatical relations.
Subject is agent   active voice
Subject is patient/theme (= not agent)   passive voice
In english, when an active sentence is transformed to a passive sentence, the former object becomes the subject.
In english, the AGENT of a passive sentence is realized in a by-pp or left out entirely.
In english, by-PPs realizing the agent are adjoined to the right of the VP.
In english, the verb that is used to form passives is be, there is also a odd type of passive formed with get.

### transitivity

Valency is the number of argument controlled by a thing, mainly by a verb.
Transitivity is a property of varbs that relates to whether a verb can take objects, and how many.
Valency is different from transitivity in that it counts arguments, and thus also the subject.
In general, the valency of a verb or similar is one higher than its transitivity.

0|impersonal/avalent
1|monovalnet
2|divalent
...

intransitive|doesn't take an object
transitive|takes an object
ditransitive|takes two objects
tritransitive|takes three objects
ambitransitive|may take an object or not

Ditransitive verbs take two objects, which in english may be termed the direct and indirect object.
In languages which mark grammatical case, it is common to differentiate the objects of a ditransitive verb using, for example, the accusative case for the direct object, and the dative case for the indirect object. In languages without morphological case (such as English for the most part) the objects are distinguished by word order and/or context. However, there exist differences in morphosyntactic alignment.

### causative

A causative indicates that someone/thing causes someone/thing else to do/be something.
A causative increases the valency of the verb involved.

### ergativity

an unergative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is an agent.
an unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is not an agent.

In linguistics, morphosyntactic alignment is the grammatical relationship between arguments.
Morphosyntactic alignment is more specifically used for the relationship between the two arguments (in English, subject and object) of transitive verbs like the dog chased the cat, and the single argument of intransitive verbs like the cat ran away.
The most common types of morphosyntactic alignment are nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive, though there are others.
All languages I speak are nominative-accusative languages.
In a nominative-accusative (or just accusative) language, the specifier of an intransitive verb is treated like the specifier of a transitive verb grammatically, while the complement of a transitive verb is treated differently.
In a ergative-absolutive (or just ergative) language, the specifier of an intransitive argument is treated like the complement of a transitive verb grammatically, while the specifier of a transitive verb acts differently,

### evidentiality

Evidentiality is the grammatical feature encoding what kind of evidence there is for a given statement.
A feature that encodes evidentiality is known as an evidential or verificational/validational

Following the typology of Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004, 2006), there are two broad types of evidential marking:

indirectivity marking ("type I")
evidential marking ("type II")

The first type (indirectivity) indicates whether evidence exists for a given statement, but does not specify what kind of evidence. The second type (evidentiality proper) specifies the kind of evidence (such as whether the evidence is visual, reported, or inferred).

type II evidentiality contains a bunch of distinctions, which may blend together:

witness/nonwitness: whether the source is direct eyewitnessing or obtained otherwise (secondhand, inferral, logical deduction, etc.)
firsthand/secondhand/thirdhand: may be orthogonal to witness/nonwitness since information may be firsthand but nonwitness (e.g. own inferral)
sensory: Which senses does the information stem from
inferential: Evidence was not personally experienced but inferred from indirect evidence.
Reportative evidentials indicate that the information was reported to the speaker by another person. A few languages distinguish between hearsay evidentials and quotative evidentials. Hearsay indicates reported information that may or may not be accurate. A quotative indicates the information is accurate and not open to interpretation, i.e., is a direct quotation.

Often languages form evidentiality systems based on a combination of some of the possible evidentials, e.g. {visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential, reportative}

### others


Clusivity is the grammatical feature encoding the difference between inclusive and exclusive first-person plural reference.
Inclusive first-person plural reference includes the adressee, exclusive first-person plural reference excludes the adressee.

### tense-aspect-mmod

tense, aspect and modality are three grammatical features that are often strongly entangled in a given language and thus hard to separate.
for something to be a tense, aspect or modality it must be marked on the verb/vp.
Modality marked on a verb/VP is known as mood, however some authors also treat them as synonyms.
The marking of tense, aspect and modality is sometimes known as tense-aspect-mood
tense-aspect-mood is most often marked on verbs or via auxiliary verbs.

#### aspect

Aspect is tells you how time flows within the process/event itself.
Aspect may be divided into grammatical aspect, which is aspect indicated through inflection, and lexical aspect, which is inherent in a certain lexeme.
Aspect encodes different distinctions:
Eventive: Perfective/Imperfective
Inchoative/Cessative/ø
Prospective/Retrospective/ø
Gnomic/anything else

table:span=3;Eventive
span=1;⟮c+;s1:4;Perfective⟯|span=4;⟮c+;s1:4;Imperfective⟯
|span=2;⟮c+;s1:2;Habitual⟯|span=2;⟮c+;s1:2;Continuous⟯
|||⟮c+;s3:5;Progressive⟯|⟮c+;s3:5;Stative⟯


Perfective and imperfective aspect together make up the eventive aspect

perfective|event viewed in its entirety ( = without internal complexity)
Imperfective|event viewed with some sort of internal complexity 
Continuous|ongoing situation without interruption
Habitual|habitual, usual, customary action (imperfective but not continuous)
Progressive|continuous: ongoing and evolving 
Stative|continuous: ongoing but not evolving

There are other imperfective aspects:

Iterative aspect "signals that an action is repeated on a single occasion and differs from frequentative aspect, which both signal the repetition occurred on different occasions" (p. 160). 

Habitual be is a feature of AAVE indicating habitual aspect.
Spanish distinguishes imperfective and perfective verbs in the preterite tense.
In german, 'imperfekt' and 'perfekt' indicate tense, not aspect, despite their names!

The inchoative/cessative aspect indicates how the state is changing during the specified time.
Inchoative aspect is aspect indicating that something is beginning (however not that something is about to begin).
Cessative aspect is aspect indicating that something is ending.

The prospective/retrospective aspect indicates when an event takes place relative to the reference time.
Prospective aspect is aspect indicating that an event occurs subsequent to a reference time.
Retrospective aspect (commonly but confusingly also called perfect aspect, not to be confused with perfective aspect) is aspect indicating that an event occurs before a reference time.

Telicity (telic/atelic) is the grammatical feature of whether something has a specific endpoint.
Telicity is most often considered an aspect.

Gnomic aspect is an apsect indicating general truths.
The opposite of gnomic aspect is episodic aspect, truths that are temporally bounded.

#### modality

modality is a grammatical feature used to discuss possible situations. 
Different forms of modality are sometimes called flavors.
Modalities are primarily distingished along two axes: deontic/epistemic and realis/irreals
Deontic modality is modality that is concerned with how the world ought to be.
Epistemic modality is modality that is concerned with knowledge, belief or credence.
Realis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is the case.
Irrealisa= moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is somehow not the case.
Most languages have a single realis mood/modality called the indicative mood/modality, although some languages have additional realis moods, for example to express different levels of certainty.
Distinction between different types of modality may not always be clear-cut, since different languages use different analyses.

Non-indicative realis moods are 
energetic: emphasis or strong belief
gnomic: general truths or aphorisms

Types of epistemic irrealis modalities
Subjunctive modality is a type of epistemic irrealis modality indicating that something is unlikely, this is generally used in subordinate clauses.
Potential modality is a type of epistemic irrealis modality indicating that something is likely. This may also be called tentative when talking about japanese, as potential means something else.
Dubitative modality is a type of epistemic irrealis modality indicating that something is dubious/doubtful or uncertain.
Speculative modality is a type of epistemic irrealis modality indicating that something is mere speculation.
Hypothetical modality is a type of epistemic irrealis modality indicating that while something did not happen, it could have happened.
Assumptive modality is a type of epistemic irrealis modality indicating that something is true because it is usually true in similar circumstances.

Types of deontic irrealis modalities

Deontic modality may be roughly dividend into commissive, directive and volitive:
commmissive|commital to something
directive|commands, requests, etc.
volitive|wishes, desires etc.

Permissive modality is a type of directive modality indicating that something is permitted
Imperative modality is a type of directive modality indicating a command.
Hortative modality is a type of directive modality indicating one is trying to encourage or discourage an action.
Prohibitive/vetative modality is a type of directive modality indicating that something is prohibited.
Propositive modality is a type of directive modality indicating a proposal or suggestion.
Propositive modality is a type of directive modality indicating that something should be brought about.

Desiderative modality is a type of volitive deontic modality indicating that one wants something.
Optative modality is a type of volitive deontic modality indicating Event is hoped/wished

Types of irrealis modalities not clearly epistemic/deontic
Conditional|Event depends on another condition

mirativity is an epistemic modality of which it is not clear if it is realis or irrealis.
Mirative|surprise/unpreparedness in relation to a given thing

# morphology

⟮Morphemes⟯ are the ⟮smallest⟯ ⟮unit of language⟯ that ⟮has some sort of meaning⟯. 
⟮Morphemes⟯ are studied in the field of ⟮morphology⟯. 
⟮Morphology⟯ generally deals with the ⟮phonology⟯ and not ⟮orthography⟯ of morphs/morphemes, as s⟮peech is more basic to language than writing⟯. 
A ⟮morpheme⟯, bearing ⟮a unit of meaning⟯, is made up of ⟮allomorphs⟯, which are ⟮the different phonetic realizations of that morpheme⟯. 
The word ⟮unbreakable⟯ consists of the morpheme ⟮un, break, able.⟯ 
⟮Morphs⟯ and ⟮morphemes⟯ are generally written in ⟮curly braces {⟯}. 
{{c17::{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /}}} are all ⟮allomorphs⟯ of {{c19::the morpheme {s} (plural s)}} 

Alternation is a morpheme exhibiting variation in its phonological realization based on its phonological/morophological and/or syntactic environment. Variants are called alternants. TODO: is this equivalent to allomorphs?
Alternation (a synchronic morphological phenomenon) needs to be distinguished from sound change (a diachronic phenomenon).
A null/zero morpheme is a morpheme that has no phonetic form/realization.

## Word formation

Word formation is broadly the creation of new words.
Word formation may either be the creation of variant forms of a lexeme via inflection (e.g. fly-flew), or the creation of new lexemes.
Word formation as the creation of new lexemes is known as derivation.
Derivation may be morphological or nonmorphological.
Morphological derivation is derviation by adding or removing morphemes.
Nonmorphological derivation is derivation that is not directly related to the morphemes in the base.

A portmanteu is where parts of multiple words are combined into a new word/morph.
A blend/blend word word/lexical blend is a portmanteu where at least one of the parts combined is not a morph.
Sometimes, portmanteus and blends are considered synonyms, i.e. the restriction that a blend is a thing where one thing is not a morph is dropped.
In linguistics, a portmanteu or portmanteu morph may also be the merger of multiple morphs into one morph.
Examples of blend words are smog (smoke + fog) or brunch (breakfast + lunch)

For example, -t in spanish might be a portmanteu morph of the morph for 3rd person and for singular, took may be considered a portmanteu morph of take + ed.

### morphological

In linguistics, clipping, also called truncation or shortening, is word formation by removing some segments of an existing word to create a synonym.
Clipping: Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu
Clipping is also different from back-formation, which proceeds by (pseudo-)morpheme rather than segment, and where the new word may differ in sense and word class from its source.

A hybrid word is a morphological derivation that derives from at least two different languages. 
The most common ⟮hybrid words⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived part⟯
⟮asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)⟯ are examples for ⟮hybrid words⟯

### nonmorphological

#### abbreviation

An abbreviation is a nonmorphological derivation by shortening a word.

While rareish, there are some abbreviations that use a slash, generally separating two characters representing two morphemes, but not in an 'or' rleationship (e.g. w/o, b/w, w/e, n/a)

##### acronym

An acronym is a type of abbreviation formed from the first letters of other words.
Sometimes initialism or alphabetism is sometimes used to refer to an acronym which is pronounced as individual letters.
Sometimes initialism is a synonym for acronym.
Examples of acronyms include ATM for automated teller machine and SIA for singapore international airlines
A backronym is a word that originally was not an acronym but is turned into one.
Examples of backgronyms: SAD ("seasonal affective disorder"), SOS ("Save Our Souls")
More recent examples include the brand name Adidas, named after company founder Adolf "Adi" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sport";[15] Wiki, said to stand for "What I Know Is",[16] but in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase wiki-wiki meaning "fast";[17] or Yahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth" (taken from Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels).

##### numeronym

A numeronym at its most common is a word based on/using numbers.
Most commonly, a numeronym (a number based on/using numbers) is an abbreviation.
Numeronyms as abbreviations frequently either count the amount of letters in a word, have the numbers stand for words thus forming a weird abbreviation, or use the number metonymically.
Examples for numeronums: 9/11 (date metonym), i18n (letter count), 4649 (weird syllablecronym)
a11y  accessibility
g11n  globalization
p13n   personalization
i18n   internationalization

### Productivity

productivity is the degree to which native speakers of a language use a particular grammatical process, especially in word formation.
The polar ends of productivity are productive and unproductive.
Word formation processses that are applied very infrequently are likely unproductive.
If a word formation process can be applied to create new words, it is productive.
In english, using ablauts to create preterite verbs is unproductive, while using -ed to create preterite verbs is productive.

## Inflection

Inflection is modifying a lexeme to reflect one or more gramattical features, thus creating a new word.
Inflection is commonly done via affixation or apophony, but there are also other possible modifications.
An invariable/invariant word is a word that cannot be inflected.
Inflection can be subdivided into ⟮Declension and conjugation⟯
Name|Inflection of|
⟮Conjugation⟯|⟮Verbs⟯
⟮Declension⟯|⟮Nouns or Adjectives⟯


### Agreement

Agreement is inflection caused by other words (or similar) in the sentence.

### Inflectional paradigm

An »inflectional paradigm« is the complete set of forms that a class of words can assume ⟮when inflecting⟯
An inflectional category is a class of inflection pattern that have a common grammatical category/feature. (i.e. its any realization of a grammatical category/feature as inflection)
A lexeme that lacks some of the forms of its inflectional paradigm is defective.
beware is a verb that is defective, as we can see by the fact that we can't say she bewares (of) the dog.

A verb that follows a pattern of a typical inflectional category is called regular, else irregular.
Inflectional categories of verb conjugations are called verb clasess.

## stem, base, root

The root is the irreducable morphological core of a word, with the core lexical meaning.
The stem is the root plus any derivational changes (see derivation (word formation))
The stem is the morpheme that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections.
A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached.

### japanese stems

The stem that we most commonly call 'stem' in english is the 
stem of ru-verb is verb - る
Stem of u-verb is ‹consonant›u → ‹consonant›i

## free and bound forms

A free form is one that can stand on its own as a word.
'cat', 'fire'
A bound form is a morpheme that onlly appears as part of a larger word.
'-ment'
A bound/free morpheme is a bound/free form that is a morpheme.

### affixes

Affixes are bound morphemes attached to the stem for word formation.
prefix|before the word|a- (e.g. atheist)
suffix|after the word|-s (plural suffix)
circumfix (more rarely confix or ambifix)|a affix that has a part that goes before and a part that goes after the word|o- ... -ni naru
duplfix|synonym of reduplication
infix|affix inserted into a word stem

Reduplication is the process in which a morpheme is repeated within a single word

A ⟮libfix⟯ is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮bound morpheme affix⟯ created by ⟮back-formation⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮libfixes⟯

### clitics

Clitics are bound morphemes that acts like a word in certain syntactic properties, and like an affix in that it can't stand on its own, though the boudnaries are somewhat fuzzy.
The thing that a clitic attaches to is its host.
When something is being attached as a clitic, it is ⟮cliticising⟯
```lang=text;
It☞'s☜ a boy!
I☞'m☜ terribly sorry.
The queen☞'s☜ balls.
I haven☞'t☜ the faintest.
Senatus Populus☞que☜ Romanus
``` 
Enclitic   A clitic that appears after its host
Mesoclitic   A clitic that appears between the stem of the host and other affixes
Proclitic   A clitic that appears before its host

## compounds

In linguistics, a compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one stem.
The head of a compound is the stem that is the thing that is being modified by the other stem(s) in the compound.
name|description|formalization, assuming head-final
endocentric compound|the basic type of thing is indicated by the head, and the other stems describe that|A+B denotes a kind of b|smalltalk
exocentric compound|s a hyponym of some unexpressed semantic category (such as a person, plant, or animal)|A+B denote a special kind of unexpressed thing|white-collar, scarecrow
copulative compound|the word is what any of the stems is|A+B indicate the sum of A and B|bittersweet, sleepwalk
appositional compound|all stems are equal attributes of a certain referent|A+B indicates something that is both A and B|hunter-gatherer
A dvandva is another name for an appositional compound.
If the english word for siblings was a dvandva/appositional compound and we believed in the gender binary, it would be brothersister.
Japanese forms appositional compounds, which will generally not display 連濁.
e.g. 　山（やま・さん）　川（かわ・せん） for mountains and rivers = scenery and 　左（さ）　右（ゆう） for left and right = control.
Japanese endocentric compounds will generally display 連濁 if phonotactically possible.

### english

In english, ⟮compounds⟯ can be ⟮open⟯ = ⟮containing a space⟯, e.g. ⟮real estate⟯, ⟮closed⟯ = ⟮not containing a space⟯, e.g. ⟮waistcoat, bookstore⟯, or ⟮hyphenated⟯ = ⟮containing a hyphen⟯, e.g. ⟮long-term⟯ 
In english, ⟮compounds⟯ generally ⟮progress from open to closed⟯, sometimes ⟮with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.⟯ 

An example of ⟮the typical progression of english compounds⟯ is "T⟮c+;o day" → "to-day" → "today"⟯

## errors

A surface analysis is any valid analysis of a words morphology, no matter if etymologically true.

reanalysis is a form of surface analysis, specifically an analysis of a lexeme into a different morphology than it originally had.
juncture loss is the form of reananalysis where an article and a noun fuse.
Juncture loss: al + chemy (from arabic) → alchemy

Rebracketing is also sometimes known as resegmentation or metanalysis
rebracketing is the form of reanalysis that involves analyizing a lexeme/lexical unit into a different set of morphemes

### etymological

a folk etymology (or similar) is an etymology that is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation, it may also be in a different sense be used as a synonym to reanalysis
Synonyms: folk etymology, fake etymology, false etymology, pseudoetymology

## typology

Linguistic typology according to a language's morphological structures and mainly how these languages create words from morphemes is known as morphological typology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.
Analytic languages contain very little inflection, and thus have very few morphemes per word (often close to one morpheme per word)
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.
highly analytic|chinese, vietnamese
highly synthetic|japanese, turkish

### interrogative word

An interrogative word or particle is a word used to create a kind of interrogative sentence.
Interrogative words are generally not their own part of speech, but instead fall into the category of other parts of speech.
An interrogative particle is a type of inerrogative word that converts a statement into a yes-no question.

## + semantics

### posessive

A posessive is a word or form indicating poession,
Many languages (of those I speak: en, de, es) indicate a posessive via a set of possessive determiners and pronouns.
Many languages also have a posessive verb, e.g. en/de have/haben, es tener.
In japanese, the job of the posessive verb is done by extential verbs/clausees.


### numerals

A numeral is a word or phrase that describes a numerical quantity.
Numerals may be seen as their own part, or as an abstract concept that may be instantiated by different parts of speech.
Across languages, numerals seem to be able to act as nouns, pronouns or adverbs.
Numerals are generally based on one or more counting systems.
In linguistics, measure words are words (or morphemes) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate a semantically qualified amount.
There are different kind of numerals (whether realized as words or phrases): 
ordinal numerals|position in sequence
cardinal numerals|amount/quantity
multipliers|
distributive numerals|
collective numerals|
Numerals are typically constructed via a counting system.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases, and stop counting every power of 10 at different numbers: most commonly at 1000 or at 10 000 (myriad)
due to the practice of wrapping at 10 000, 10 000 is used in many sinosphere languages to mean a lot, and most commonly 10k years = a long life.

#### japanese

In japanese grammar, measure words are typically called counters.
In japanese grammar, measure words are required for any numeral and when asking for quantities.
In japanese grammar, numerals, measure words and optional indicators for cardinality form a phrase (which I will call Counter Phrase).
Japanese 'counter phrases' can function in various syntactic ways: They can become no-adjectives, be used adverbially or postpositionally.

The japanese counting system:
rational-number ::= [マイナス]‹positive-rational-number›
positive-rational-number ::- ‹integer›[　点（てん）‹digit›{‹digit›}]
integer ::= {‹myriad-unit›}[‹place›][‹place›][‹place›]‹place-when-base-1›
myriad-unit ::= [‹place›][‹place›][‹place›]‹place-when-base-multiple-of-four›
place ::= ‹digit›‹base-word›
place-when-base-1 ::= ‹digit›
place-when-base-multiple-of-four ::= ‹digit›‹base-multiple-of-four-word›

Japanese digits:

0|零・丸・ゼロ


1|一|いち|ひと
2|二||ふた
3|三||みっ
4|四||よ(ん・っ)
5|五||いつ
6|六||むっ
7|七||なな
8|八||やっ
9|九||ここの

Japanese bases up to 1000

10|十|じゅう|とお
100|百|ひゃく|もも
1000|千|せん|ち

Japanese base when multiple of four words:

10^4|万|まん|よろず
10^8|億|おく|none
10^12|兆|ちょう|none

Counters

日|か|days|訓 (exception 一日：ついたち)


### demonstratives

demonstrative determiners usually map onto the spatial/discourse deixis distinction
Demonstratives usually come in two flavors, demonstrative determiners and demonstrative pronouns, which may or may not be derminers depending on your theory.

proximal|this
medial/distal|that
distal (rare)|yon(der)

proximal|este, estos|esta, estas|esto
medial|ese, esos|esa, esas|eso
distal|aquel, aquellos|aquella, aquellas|aquello

Neuter forms do not change for number.

#### Japanese

In japanese, the deictical distinction comes in form of morphemes, which form a large set of demonstratives with other morphemes.
The japanese deictical morphemes collectively are known as こそあど.

proximal|こ
medial|そ
distal|あ
question|ど

demonstrative determiner|~の
demonstrative pronoun (things)|~れ

the demonstrative determiners この、その… are originally abbreviations of これの、それの….

## linguistic error

Speech (production) error = mistake
Mistakes and errors are both unintentional deviation from the grammar of a languoid.
An error is a deviation from the grammar of a languoid that is caused by lack of knowledge about the grammar of the languoid.
A mistake is a deviation from the grammar of a languoid that is merely an error in performance, and would ordinarily not have happened.
Typically, only L2 speakers make errors, while anyone can make mistakes.
Errors may also lead to language change.
