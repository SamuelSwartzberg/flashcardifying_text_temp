# grammar (supercategory of all of this)

Most broadly, grammar is the sets of rules governing a languoid.
A reference work on the grammar of a language may also be known as a grammar, more precisely as a reference grammar.
If a string conforms to the grammar of a lect, it is called grammatical.
A grammaticality judgement is a judgement on the gramatticality of a string by a certain speaker.
grammaticality judgements are often used as linguistic evidence, generative grammar also aims to predict them.
* marks a thing that is ungrammatical.
In linguistics, an empty category is an element in the study of syntax that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.
An empty category = something unpronounced is often indicated by ø or ＊e＊
In linguistics, a string is a sequence of words/sounds that we don't want to put any deeper analytical category on just yet.

# syntax

Syntax is the study of how words and morphemes form larger units such as phrases and sentences.
Morphosyntax is where morphology and syntax interset.

## Information structure

Information structure is the subfield of linguistics describing how information is organized within a sentence.
Information structure mainly consists of the three oppoositions of focus/background, topic/comment, and givenness/new

## Expletives

An ⟮expletive⟯ is a ⟮meaningless⟯ element put in some position to ⟮fulfil a grammatical requirement⟯. (Can also mean profanity, of course)
Often words used as expletives also have other functions with more semantic content, however this semantic content is discarded when used as an expletive.
E.g. ⁑There⁑ is someone helping us here. ⁑It⁑ was raining, wasn't ⁑it⁑?

## Grammatical relations

Grammatical relations are subjects and objects, and perhaps others depending on your theory.
Grammatical relations are different things to different theorists.
The generative grammar/chomskyan approach is to see an object as the DP complement of a verb.

## labelled bracket

Labeled bracketing notation can generate an arbitrary tree, but is mostly used to generate syntax trees.
Labeled bracketing notation: tree ::= \[‹nodename {‹tree›|‹leaf›}
leaf ::= #somestring

## frameworks

Syntax is a field where there are a bunch of frameworks or theories of how it works, but not much agreement.
Generative semantics was a response to generative grammar developed in the 1960s.
The conflict between propoonents of generative grammar and generative semantics was known as the linguistics wars.
The proponents of generative semantics in the linguistics wars called themselves ⟮the four horsemen of the apocalypse⟯, amongst which was george lakoff
Generative semantics held that syntactic structures from meanings, rather than the other way around

## constituents

A constituent is a word or group of words that functions together as a single unit and has hierarchical structure.
The assembly of constitutents into larger constituents allows the generation the infinite variety of possible sentences that language is famous for.
Phrases are constituents, but not all constituents are phrases.
Constituents are identified by using constituent tests.
There are many constituent tests in english, among which are: proform substitution
proform test: Substitute the relevant proform, perform a grammaticality judgement
```lang=text;
The lady running the group handed in her resignation at noon.
The lady running the group did so at noon.
```
cleft test: Move the string into the main clause of a cleft sentence (It was/is x that...)
```lang=text;
The guests from overseas visited the best parts of the city on Monday
It was the best parts of the city that the guests from overseas visited on Monday.
```
question test: Ask for the string in question with a wh-question.
```lang=text;
The lady running the group handed in her resignation at noon.
What did the lady running the group hand in at noon?
Her resignation.
```
Movement test: move string to different position in sentence.
```lang=text;
Gertrude wasn't interested in art.
Interested in art, Gertrude wasn't.
```

## phrasees

a phrase is a constituent which acts a certain way related to other constituents and has a certain internal structure relative to its type.
The head of a phrase is the thing everything else in the phrase is about.
In a phrase, everything that isn't the head is a dependent.
In head-inital/head-final languages, the head comes at the beginning/end of the phrase, respectively
head-initial|English (partially)

### X-bar framework-based


The X-bar theory asserts that all phrases have the structure ✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png/300px-X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png✫, which is called the X-bar schema.
In the X-bar theory, each node is binary, i.e. has two children.
In the X-bar theory, each phrase has a head.
in the X-bar schema, there are four types of components in each schema.
In the X-bar schema, arguments are necessary but may be empty.
In the X-bar schema, the two types of arguments are complements and specifiers
The difference between complements and specifiers is that the complement is a sister node to X, while the specifier is a sister node to X'.
In the X-bar schema, anything that is not a head or an argument is an adjunct.
Adjuncts may also be called modifiers.
Adjuncts are optional, and adjoining them creates a phrase of the same type as it originally was.
Ergo adjoining something to a YP results in a larger YP.
Adjunction can be recursive.
An adjunct can be any type of phrase.

In the X-bar schema, XP is theoretically X''.
In the X-bar schema, X' and X'' (XP) are projections of X.

In the X-bar schema, to indicate that foo is both a head and a complete phrase (both the minimal and the maximal projection), you can

X/XP
foo

X(P)
foo

XP

X'

X

XP
|
X
foo

In the X-bar framework, a phrase consists

CP

[CP [C] [IP]]
CP may either be complement or adjunct to verb/VP
to test whether a CP is an adjunct or a complement, use a proform test on the Verb/VP without the CP.

The object is the thing that is the complement of the VP.

#### IPs

under the IP theory, the sentence is an IP headed by an I.
The argument for I as the head of the sentence goes something like: It makes sense for a sentence to be a type of phrase and has a head, inflectional information is core to a sentence, so it makes sense for that to be the head.
in the IP theory, I stands for inflection.
under the IP theory, the subject is the thing that is in the specifier of the IP.
under the IP theory, the complement of I is the VP.

class=inner;|class=inner;⟮I⟯|class=inner;⟮VP⟯
class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin



#### VP-internal subject hypothesis

According to the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject DP starts out in the VP, and them moves to the specifier of the IP later.
According to the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject DP will not move from the specifier of the VP to the specifier of the IP if the specifier of the IP is already filled by an expletive subject.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it makes the VP consistent with the X-bar schema.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it makes the subject which is semantically an argument of the V also grammatically an argument of the V.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it lets us address some discontinuities, especially in relation to adverbs.
Evidence: The subject is an argument of the V, but it appears outside of the VP, closer to I than to V.

#### DP hypothesis: 

The DP hypothesis claims that what are commonly assumed to be NPs are actuall DPs headed by a D.
The DP hypothesis argues that D can be seen as the head of a DP since the D picks out the referent, and everything, including the noun, then merely describes the D.
Intuitively, the head of "the best student of physics" seems to be "student", but the DP hypothesis claims its "the".
Part of the motivation for the DP hypothesis is that pronouns seem to be NPs without an actual N head.
The DP hypothesis is still a controversial hypothesis
The DP hypothesis often correlates with the idea that pronouns are determiners.
In the DP hypothesis, a determinerless noun has a silent/unpronounced D.

#### IP hypothesis

Auxiliaries actually start out as V, and then the top one (in the tree) moves to I.
Multiple auxiliaries are adjoined as Vs to the VP.
Assuming multiple auxiliaries as part of one I head does not work, as we can insert things such as adverbs between them.

#### early modern english

Lexical verbs could move to I, and thus to C, following the HMC.
In current english, wh-questions need do-support since something needs to fill the C position, and the verb can't, since it can't move to I.
In early modern english, wh-questions did not need do-support since the V could move to I and thus to C.
"What heards't thou?"

#### german sentences

The german main clause V2, subordinate clause V-final constituent order is explained as follows:
In german, VP and IP are head-filnal
All german clauses are CPs with pronouced Cs.
Subordinate german clauses have their C positions filled by a complementizer as usual.
If C is not filled by a complementizer (mostly main clauses), then V moves to I and then to C.
In german subordinate clauses, the V can't move to C, because that is typically already filled by a real complementizer.
If in german the V position is occupied by a compound verb, if the V moves (via I to C), what moves is the root, leaving the affix behind.
Main clauses in german have the specifier of C filled by an arbitrary constituent moving there.

### types of phrases

The type of phrase a phrase is (AdvP, VP, NP...) is called phrasal category.
An XP is a phrase with X as its head.

## clauses

A clause links a predicand (expressed or not) with a predicate.

<div class="c1-f">
Under the more wide definition, what is the predicate here?
</div>
<div class="c1-f">
Under the more narrow definition, what is the predicate here?
</div>
<div class="c1-f">
How are these often called in short?
</div><br><pre><code data-codetype="text">Bill heard Fred</code></pre> <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::heard Fread.}}
<pre><code data-codetype="text">Bill heard Fred</code></pre> <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::heard}}
In grammar, a predicate either connects the subject to an idea ('what the subject is like'), or is...? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::something that says something about a subject}}
In grammar, a predicate is either the thing that says something about the subject, or the thing that connects what to what? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::the subject to an idea ('what the subject is like')}}
In grammar, a predicate is either the thing that says something about the subject, or what, in relation to the the subject and an idea ('what the subject is like')? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::It connects the subject to an idea ('what the subject is like')}}
In grammar, either (a) something that says something about a subject or (b) something that links something a subject and what that subject is like is called... <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::a predicate}}
In grammar, what is the problem with the term predicate? <span class="divider">-&gt;</span> {{c1::It has two competing definitions}}


A clause is a type of constituent.

In linguistic typology, a null-subject language is a language whose grammar permits an independent clause to lack an explicit subject; such a clause is then said to have a null subject.
An independent clause always features a subjecti or has a null subject.
Languages I speak that are null-subject languages are spanish and japanese.

Subordinate clause = dependent clause
A subordinate/dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence.
Independent clause = main clause ≈ root clause ≈ matrix clause
A independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

### subordinate clauses

An embedded question is a question that is a subordinate clause.
As CPs generally are, embedded questions are adjuncts of the VP or complements of the verb (in japanese too)

#### relative clause

A relative clause is a subordinate clause that describes a DP/NP
A ⟮relative clause⟯ is a ⟮subordinate clause⟯ which generally ⟮describes the referent of its head⟯.
I met a furry who was passionate.
In indo-european languages, a relative clause is generally introduced by a relative pronoun.

### interrogative

In syntax, an interrogative clause has a particular type of syntax and/or prosoody, which is typically used to ask question (attach the illocutionary act/force of asking a question).
Languages may have diffrent types of interrogative clauses (i.e. different syntaxes used to ask different types of questions).
A question iteself is an illocutionary act/force seeking to obtain an answer.
In many languages, besides syntax/prosody, written exchanges often indicate interrogatives by special punctuation.

If syntax is used to indicate an interrogative, it may be in the form of conjugating the verb, changing the word order, adding interrogative words, particles, or other constituents, or often a combination of these.

#### conjugation

#### word order

##### I-to-C movement

In english, wh-questions and yes/no questions alike are marked by I-to-C movement.
In english interrogatives that are not subject questions, the sentence becomes a CP.
In english interrogatives, the newly formed C position is filled by I moving to C.
In english interrogatives, if there is no I to move to C, I is made pronounced via do-support.

##### wh-movement

A wh-question is a interrogative sentence using a wh-word.
Wh-questions typically feature wh-movement.
wh-movement is a form of head movement.
The wh-constituent moves from and therefore its trace is to be found in where it would be in an answer to the question, unless it is in situ.
A wh in situ question is a wh-question where the wh-prhase does not move.
She was reading what? They went where? She spoke to who(m)?
A subject question in english is where the wh-phrase is the subject of the sentence.
Of the wh-questions, subject questions are the only ones that don't feature I to C movement, and thus also no do-support.
the syntax of a subject question has the same syntax as a statement.

Places out of which constituents for wh-questions are impossible to extract   islands
There are a bunch of islands:
- No extraction of one of the conjuncts of a coordinated phrase.
- No extraction out of a CP inside a DP
- No extraction out of a subject (for most English speakers)
- No extraction out of adjuncts
Besides out of islands, wh-movement will be ungrammatical if it does not comply with the shortest move / minimal link condition: The move must be the shortest possible = there must not be a wh-element that would have to move less far.

#### adding constituents

##### tag questsions

A tag question is an interrogative clause which is formed from a declarative clause plus a question tag.
A question tag is an interrogative fragment.
Most languages have an (or multiple) simple question tag(s) allowing for tag question formation.
question tags come in two basic flavors, asking one to confirm or asking one to deny.
Examples of question tags:
en|right?|no?, or no?
de|stimmts?, gell?, wa?, ne?|nicht wahr?, oder nicht?
es|verdad?|no?
English as well as some other languages allow  to the end of a declarative clause to turn it into an interrogative clause.
English as welll as a few other languages have specific grammar for forming more complex tag question fragments, in english: aux + pronoun

##### interrogative words ＆ particles

In english, interrogative words start with wh- and are thus known as wh-words.


### ordination

Coordination/subordination may imply different semantic relationships between the conjuncts.
illative|presents a consequence
cumulative|adds more
adversative|introduces a contrast
disjunctive|selfexpl.

causal|presents a reason
purposive|
conditional|
concessional|
comparative|
temporal|

In english, coordination/subordination is most often performed by conjunctions.

#### coordination

Coordination is the process of linking two things of the same type.
The two things linked via coordination are called conjuncts.
The totality of coordinator(s) and conjuncts forming an instance of coordination is called a coordinate structure.

#### subordination

Subordination is linking two things (maincly clauses), where one depends on the other.
A complement clause is an argument of a predicate.
A complementizer turns a clause into 
A complementizer turns a clause into the subject or object of a sentence.
In english, the complementizer 'that' sometimes is unpronounced
Akane thought that Lilly was a いい子. ⇒ Akane thought Lilly was a いい子. 

## sentences

A sentence consists of one or more clausees.
A simple sentence consists of one (main/independent) clause.
A complex sentence consists of at least one main/independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
A sentence is a constituent cannot be further joined into larger constituents.
A major sentence we might consider a 'normal sentence' following the usual syntactic rules etc.
A minor sentence is a sentence without the usual subject-predicate/constituent structure.
Minor sentences generally do not allow substitution of items of the same word class: Merry Christmas!; *Merry Birthday!
A sentence word (also called a one-word sentence) is a single word that forms a full sentence.

A cleft sentence splits a simple sentence up into a complex sentence. 
Cleft seentence typically put the constituent now in the independent clause into focus.
Syntax of cleft sentences in english: it + conjugated form of to be + X + subordinate clause

## movement

discontinuity is the phenomenon where a constituent is split into two parts ⟮due to the insertion of an element which is not part of it⟯
Syntactic movement is the means by which some theories of syntax address discontinuities.
Two types of movement often distinguished are phrasal and head movement.
In phrasal movement, an entire phrase moves.
In head movement is when only a head of a phrase moves, leaving its dependents behind.

In chomskyian theories, movement leaves behind an empty category called a trace.
Traces are indicated by t and subscripted with a letter or  number indicating what moved, this is known as coindexing.
Some of the evidence of traces is that we can't contract over them.

In syntax, something is "in situ" if it doesn't move, although it normally would.

### head movement 

The Head Movement Constraint (HMC) is the rule that a head H can only move to a position occupied by the head which selects HP as its complement.
Due to the HMC, the only way a constiutent can move to a position that isn't selecting HP as its complement is via stepwise movement.
The head movement contraint only applies to head movement, obv.
According to the HMC, I can only move to a position that sellects IP as its complement.
If english lexical verbs wanted to move to C in y/n questions, it would have to move to I first.

#### prepositions

When the object of a transitive preposition moves, what may happen to the prepostion is either preposition stranding or pied piping.
An entire expression moves, instead of leaving something behind   Pied Piping
A head moves and leaves behind a preposition   Preposition stranding


## parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar grammatical properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Part of speech may be synonymous with lexcial category if we don't acknowledge functional categories.
a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members
Clear distingction of word classes are difficult across languages.
Often the things we think of a ertain word class doing is actually what a phrase headed by that thing does.

A|Adjective
P|Adposition
Adv|Adverb
Comp|coordinating conjunction
D|Determiner
N|Noun
V|Verb

esp. in generative grammar, functional and lexical categories are often distinguished.
functional category|purely grammatical meaning|Det, Conj, Aux...
lexical category|some sort of semanting content|V, N, A, Adv...

A word that is a member of a functional category is called a function word.
A word that is a member of a lexical category is called a content word.

### particle

A particle is a function word (member of a functional category) which cannot be inflected.
A particle occurring at the end of the sentence is a sentence-final particle.
Particles do not refer.
Sentence-final particles in particular generally indicate modality, register or other pragmatic effects.

### Interjections

An interjection is a lexical item that indicates a reaction. 
Interjections are pretty separated from the rest of the syntax of the sentence.
Interjections are a syntactic category, while discourse marker is a pragmatic category.

### adjective

An adjective (phrase) describes a thing or restricts its referent.
Adjective phrases in english can exist syyntactically in three ways: an attributive adjective, a predicative adjective and a nominalized adjective.
An attributive adjective phrase is adjoined to an NP.
A predicative adjective phrase has the adjective phrase as the complement of the verb.
A nominalized adjective works as the head of an NP.

### adverb

In english at least, adverb(ial) phrases (and thus adverbs) act as a modifier/adjunct for any number of phrases, but not NPs (which is instead handled by APs).
Adverbial phrases describes the thing its modifying.
Adverbs/adverbial phrases are at least able to modify other AdvPs, APs, DPs, PPs, VPs, and IPs.

### noun

Nouns are heads of NPs.
NPs (no DP theory) matter because they are the things that can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions.
If we believe in the DP theory, NPs matter because they are the complements of Ds, and DPs are the things that can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions.

#### attribution

In grammar, something attributive is a phrase within a NP/DP that modifies the head noun. 
Adnnominal seems to be a synonym for attributive
In english, relative clauses and attributive adjectives are the main things that act attributively.
A verb that can be used attributively is known as an attributive verb.

### det

A determiner is a word/affix that occurs that occurs together with a NP and expresses something about the reference of the noun phrase.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner
Types of determiners: Articles, Demonstrative determiners, Quantifiers, distributive determiners, interrogative determiners

#### Quantifier

Quantifiers are a type of determiner/pronoun (which may depending on your analysis may be a quantifier too).
quantifiers are adjoined to the DP/NP to form a larger DP/NP.
table:span=2;⟮DP⟯
⟮Q/D⟯|⟮DP⟯
all|the students

Floating quantifier is a quantifier that is not immediately near the NP/DP it quantifies.
According to the VP-int-subj-hyp, floating quantifiers happen because of the two DPs that could move to the subject position in the specifier position of the IP, the smaller DP moves, leaving the quantifier behind.
The existence of floating quantifiers provides evidence for the VP-internal subject hypothesis by explainin why the quantifier is in this position.

#### Articles

Examples of Articles in EN: the, an, a

#### posessive determiners

my, your, his, her, its, our, their

### adpositions

An adposition may either be a preposition, circumposition or a postposition.
semantically, adpositions may be temporal adpositions, spatial adpositions, or adpositions that mark a different semantic/thematic role.
Adpositions may be transitive or intransitive.
Intransitive adpositions are often called adverbs, though that's probably an inferior analysis.
Intransitive adposition examples: here/everywhere/downstairs/ahead/outside/...
Transitive adpositions may take other adpositions as complements.

### conj

Conjunctions either perform coordination or subordination.

### proforms

Proforms are function words that stand in for another constituent.
DP/NP|Pronouns
NP/N'|one
Verb|do (so)
Temporal adposition|then
Spatial adposition|there
other adposition|none exists

#### pronouns

Pronouns are proforms that stand for NPs, or DPs if we believe in them, not for nouns themselves.

A pro-drop language is a language where certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically or grammatically inferable. 
Japanese and Spanish are pro-drop, German and English are, with rare exceptions, not.

##### personal

Personal pronouns are pronouns that are associated primarily with a particular grammatical person.


### copula (and existential verbs)

A copula is a word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to its complement/predicate.
The tree ☞is☜ blue.
Depending on the language, a copula may or may not be a verb.
An existential verb indicates the existence of something.
In some languages the copula and the main existential verb are the same, of those I speak, only english: to be (The chair is green, there is a god)
In some languages the copula and the main existential verb are different:
es|ser/estar|haber
de|sein|geben
ja|だ|ある・いる

Some languages distinguish different existential verbs for different semantic categories.
Japanese distinguishes its existential verbs ある・いる along a inanimate/animate distinction.

### verbs

#### dynstat

Dynamic and static verbs are often contrasted.
A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action.
A stative (unclear relation to stative aspect) verb is a verb that descirbes a state.
setzen is a dynamic verb while sitzen is a dynamic verb.

#### aux

Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
In English, sentences without auxiliars cannot have negation.
In English, auxiliaries cannot take an object (complement of the VP), while lexical verbs can.
Auxiliary verbs are members of the functional category, while lexical verbs are members of the lexical category.
In English, auxiliaries go before the subject DP/NP in question inversion.
have and do may or may not be auxiliary verbs.
dummy do is do used as an auxiliary verb.
using dummy do is called do-support
do-support is used when an axuliary verb is syntactically required but none is present.

### changing parts of speech

#### nominalization

Nominalization is the process of treating / transforming something which is not a noun as / into a noun / head of an NP.
A nominalizer is a thing, usually a bound morpheme, that nominalizes a thing.

## word order

Word order is how a language orders the syntacic constituents of a language.
Word order may be a distinguishing characteristic in linguistic typology.
Even languages which typically allow large amounts of flexibility in word order (e.g. by marking case) generally have a typical word order, where having a different order is considered marked. (see: Japanese)

### constituent order

the constituent order of a clause, namely the relative order of subject, object, and verb, is one way to distinguish word order.
German has verb-second constituent order in main clauses and verb-final constituent order in subordinate clauses.
SOV, SVO, etc

Verb-final language place the verb at the end of a clause.
Completely verb-final: japanese

V2 word order is that the verb comes in the second syntactically relevant place of the sentence, and the first can be filled by a variety of different constituents.
In V2 word order, the first constituent functions as the topic.

A linguistic universal is a pattern that occurs systematically across (most often all) natural languages.


# grammatical feature

A grammatical feature is more rarely called grammatical category.
A grammatical feature feature (my term) is a feature in the general sense that encodes a grammatical distinction.
A grammatical feature category is a category consisting of an inventory of grams, of which a language may disinguish some grammemes.
Grammatical feature is ambiguous between gramamtical feature feature and grammatical feature category.
Some languages may not make any distinction within a grammatical feature.
Grammemes may be encoded lexically or morphologically.
Grammemes encode a sememe.

## phi-features (noun-related)

phi-features is a group of grammatical feature categories related to nouns which are encoded morphologically as inflectional paradigms.
Phi-features often force agreement on noun-related things, and sometimes on verbs too.
Phi-features include number, noun class and case.

### noun class

Noun class is a phi-feature encoding a variety of different sememes not covered by number or case.
Grammatical gender is a form of noun-class system where the grammemes distinguished are male, female, and possibly neuter.

### number

Grammatical number is a phi-feature encoding sememes of distinctions in amounts.
Grammatical number may distinguish actual amount or grouping.

#### amount

table:name|sememe
Singular|one
Dual|two
Trial|three
Paucal|a few
Plural|many (more than one if only singular/plural)


If a language distinguishes actual amount via grammatical number, most commonly it only has two grammemes, singular/plural.
In languages with a singular/plural distinction, most often the singular is the unmarked form,.

##### grouping

Distinguishing grouping via grammatical number is generally realized in a singulative/collective distinction.
The collective grammatical number is a group with no distinction into individual entities (similar to english mass nouns)
The singulative grammatical entitity refers to a specific entity.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the collective form is generally the unmarked one.

#### in languages

English, German and Spanish have grammatical number that distinguishes Singular and Plural, Japanese does not have grammatical number.

### case

Grammatical case is a phi-feature encoding semantic relationsip or grammatical relation/morphosyntactic alignment.

#### encoding morphosyntactic alignment

table:case|grammatical relation
Accusative|object of a verb
Nominative|Subject of a verb

Dative case is sometimes said to mark the indirect object, but the indirect object is just an english construct for describing a certain kind of object of a verb. in this sense, many cases mark something that is an object or at least argument of a verb, not just dative.
Dative indicates recipient or benificiary of an action.

#### encoding semantic relationsip

Various possible case grams can overlap, since most languages only realize a handful of them per language as grammemes.

##### movement

table:case|semantic relationship
lative|movement to a location.
ablative|indicates a movement away from a location.
Illative|into
Elative|out of
Inelative|"from inside"
Egressive|beginning of a movement from a location or time ('starting from')
Prolative/vialis/prosecutive/traversal/mediative|by way of, via
perlative|through, across, along

##### location

table:case|semantic relationship
locative|location
Inessive|within
Superessive|on top of, on the surface of.
subessive|below
Pertingent|touching x
Intrative|"amidst"

##### cause, purpose, means, use

table:case|semantic relationship
benefactive|something is done for the benefit someone/is intended for someone.
Terminative/terminalis|a limit in space/time and/or the goal/target of an action.
Instrumental|a means or tool used or companion present in/while performing an action	
Ornative|endowed with, supplied with
Vocative|adressee


Benefactive case is often included in the dative case.

##### presence, absence

table:case|semantic relationship
Genitive|posess⁑or⁑
Abessive/caritive/privative|absence of the thing.
Comitative|accompaniment

##### comparison, identity

table:case|semantic relationship
Identical|something is identical to another
Equative|something is the same value as another
Comparative|something is like something (e.g. cold as ice)
Exessive|away from a state
Translative|becoming X, changing to X

##### additional information

In english, the word with performs the function of both comitative and instrumental cases, this case is sometimes called the instrumental-comitative case..


## mainly related to verbs

### grammatical person

Grammatical person is the grammatical feature category that encodes the sememe(s) of personal deixis.
Grammatical person is frequently realized in ⟮personal pronouns⟯ and ⟮verbs⟯ (but sometimes also in other places).
Most languages distinguish three forms of grammatical person, first, second and third person.


table:grammatical person|deictically refers to
First person|The speaker
Second person|The addressee
Third person|neither speaker nor addressee

#### clusivity

Clusivity is the grammatical feature feature (part of grammatical person) encoding the difference between two kinds of first person plural reference.
[+inclusive/-exclusive] includes the addressee, [-inclusive/+exclusive] excludes the addressee.

### arguments & morphosyntactic alignment

#### valency

Valency is the grammatical feature category encoding the number of arguments controlled by a thing, mainly by a verb.
Transitivity is like valency, but only counts objects (excludes the subject).
The valency of a verb or similar is one higher than its transitivity.
Words counting valency are formed with numeral (both latinate and greek are used) + valent
e.g. mono/univalent, divalent, trivalent, tetra/quadrivalent...
Words counting transitivity are formed with numeral (both latinate and greek are used) + transitive
An ambitransitive verb is one with a transitivity of 0 or 1 (may take a verb or not)
The two objects of a ditransitive/trivalent verb in english may be termed the direct and indirect object.

#### morphosyntactic alignment

Mrphosyntactic alignment (wide) is the grammatical relationship between arguments.
Morphosyntactic alignment (narrow) is the relationship between the two arguments of transitive verbs, and the single argument of intransitive verbs.

##### types

The most common types of morphosyntactic alignments (narrow) are nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive, though there are others.
All languages I speak are nominative-accusative languages.

###### nom acc

Nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment is often shortened to accusative morphosyntactic alignment.
With nominative-accusative morphosyntacitic alignment, the specifier of an intransitive verb is treated like the specifier of a transitive verb grammatically, while the complement of a transitive verb is treated differently.
e.g. Julius venit → julius brutum vidit

In nominative-accusative languages with case systems, for ditransitive verbs the complement (direct object) will typically get the accusative acase, and the second object will recieve e.g. the dative case.

###### erg abs

Ergative-absolutive morphosyntactic alignment is often shortened to ergative morphosyntactic alignment.
With ergative-absolutive morphosyntactic, the specifier of an intransitive argument is treated like the complement of a transitive verb grammatically, while the specifier of a transitive verb acts differently,
e.g. fake ergative latin: Julius venit → Julium brutus vidit.

##### ergativity

an unergative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is an agent.
an unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is not an agent.

#### grammatical voice

Voice is a grammatical feature category encoding the mapping semantic roles related to agency over grammatical relations.
Grammatical voice is generally realized on verbs/VPs.
The two most common grammatical voices are active and passive.
In the active voice, the subject is the agent.
In the passive voice, the subject is not the agent (e.g. patient, them)

##### english

In english, when an active sentence is transformed to a passive sentence, the former object becomes the subject.
In english, the AGENT of a passive sentence is realized in a by-pp or left out entirely.
In english, by-PPs realizing the agent are adjoined to the right of the VP.
In english, the most common verb that is used to form passives is be
In english, there is also a odd type of passive formed with get.

### tense-aspect-mood

tense-aspect-mood is the combination of tense, aspect and mood.
tense, aspect and mood are all grammatical feature categoriess marked on verbs or VPs.
tense-aspect-mood exists since the three grammatical feature categories are often strongly entangled in a given language and thus hard to separate.
Modality marked on a verb/VP is known as mood, however some authors also treat them as synonyms.

#### tense

#### aspect

Aspect is the grammatical feature category encoding how the event relates to time in general.
Depending on how the grammemes are encoded, aspect may be divided into grammatical aspect and lexical aspect.
Grammatical aspect is aspect encoded in inflectional morphology.
Lexical aspect is aspect encoded in lexical items.

Aspect can be divided into five rough distinctions:
- eventive
- howfar
- spective
- scope
- telicity

##### eventive

Eventive aspect indicates how time flows within the process/event itself.
Language may have some subdivisions of eventive aspect as grammemes, but not have others 
e.g. a language might have perfective, imperfective and stative eventive aspect, but not any of the others

###### division

Eventive
  Perfective
  Imperfective
    Iterative
    Frequentative
    Habitual
    Continuous
      Progressive
      Stative

###### relation

Eventive aspect may be divided into perfective and imperective aspect.
perfective aspect is the event viewed in its entirety ( = without internal complexity).
Imperfective aspect is event viewed with some sort of internal complexity.
Imperfective aspect may sometimes be divided into iterative, frequentative, habitual and continuous (though there may be others)
Habitual, iterative and frequentative aspect all indicate that something is repeated.
Habitual aspect indicates that the action is repeated as one would a habit on different occasions.
Frequentatie aspect indicates that the action is repeated on different occasions, but not necessarily as one would a habit.
Iterative aspect indicates that the action is repeated multiple subsequent times (e.g.knocking (repeatedly), kissing (repeatedly)) during the same occasion.
Continuous aspect indicates an ongoing situation/action without interruption.
Continuous aspect may sometimes be divided into progressive and stative.
Progressive aspect is a continuous aspect where the situation/action is evolving/changing.
Stative aspecti is a continuous aspect where the situation/action is not evolving/changing.

###### realizations in languges

Habitual be is a feature of AAVE indicating habitual aspect.
Spanish distinguishes imperfective and perfective verbs in the preterite tense.
In german, 'imperfekt' and 'perfekt' indicate tense, not aspect, despite their names!

##### howfar

howfar aspect (my term) indicates how the state is changing during the specified time.
howfar aspect may be inchoative, cessative or ø.
Inchoative aspect is howfar aspect indicating that something is beginning (however not that something is about to begin).
Cessative aspect is howfar aspect indicating that something is ending.

##### prospective/retrospective

The spective (my term) aspect indicates when an event takes place relative to the reference time.
spective aspective may be prospective, retrospective, or ø.
Prospective aspect is spective aspect indicating that an event occurs subsequent to a reference time.
Retrospective aspect is spective aspect indicating that an event occurs before a reference time.
Retrospective aspect is commonly but confusingly also called perfect aspect, not to be confused with perfective aspect.

##### gnomic/episodic

The scope aspect (my term) indicates what kind of scope something being the fact has.
Scope aspect may be gnomic, episodic, or ø.
Gnomic aspect is the scope apsect indicating general truths.
Episodic aspect is the scope aspect indicating truths that are temporally bounded.

##### telic/atelic

Telicity is the grammatical feature (mostly seen as an aspect) of whether something has a specific endpoint.
Telicity may be telic, atelic, or ø.

#### modality

modality is a grammatical feature category encoding possible situations. 
Different forms of modality are sometimes called flavors.

##### deontic/epistemic, realis/irrealis

Modalities are primarily distingished along two axes: deontic/epistemic and realis/irreals
Deontic modality is modality that is concerned with how the world ought to be.
Epistemic modality is modality that is concerned with knowledge/belief/credence.
Realis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is the case.
Irrealis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is somehow not the case.
Distinction between different types of modality may not always be clear-cut, since different languages use different analyses.

##### realis epistemic

Most (but not all) languages have a single realis mood/modality called the indicative mood/modality.

Possible epistemic realis modalitites are energetic, gnomic or the various evidential modalites.
Energetic is an epistemic realis mood indicating emphasis or strong belief.
Gnomic is an epistemic realis mood indicating general truths or aphorisms. 

###### evidentiality

Evidentiality (wide sense) is the grammatical feature category encoding what kind of evidence there is for a given statement.
Evidentiality (wide sense) is most commonly analyzed as a mood.
Evidential = verificational = validational
An evidential is a feature that encodes evidentiality (wide sense).

The typology of evidentiality (wide sense) was mainly created by Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004, 2006).
There are two kinds of evidentiality (wide sense): indirectivity and evidentiality proper.
Indirectivity is sometimes called type I, evidentiality type II.
Indirectivity is the type of evidentiality (wide sense) that encodes whether evidence exists, but not what kind.
Evidentiality proper is the type of evidentiality (wide sense) that encodes what kind of evidence exists.

####### evidentiality proper

Evidentiality proper contains a certain number of grammatical feature features.
Most languages build evidentials proper grammemes from a combination of the various grammatical feature features of evidentiality proper.
The grammatical feature features making up the grammatical feature cateogory evidentiality proper are [+/- witness], [+/- firsthand/secondhand/thirdhand], [+/- sensory], [+/- inferential], [+/- reportative], [+/- assumed].
The evidentiality proper grammatical feature feature [+/- sensory] may sometimes contain subfeatures [+/- visual] or [+/- auditory]
The reportative proper grammatical feature feature [+/- sensory] may sometimes contain subfeatures [+/- hearsay] or [+/- quotativve]

##### irrealis epistemic

The common epistemic irrealis modalities are subjunctive, potential, dubitative, speculative, hypothetical, assumptive


table:epistemic irrealis modality|meaning
Subjunctive|something is unlikely, this is generally used in subordinate clauses.
Conditional|Something is a dependent on another thing.
Tentative|something is likely
Dubitative|something is dubious/doubtful or uncertain.
Speculative|something is mere speculation.
Hypothetical|while something did not happen, it could have happened.
Assumptive|something is true because it is usually true in similar circumstances


The tentative mood is more commonly called potential, but this is a different meaning than the potential in japanese 

##### deontic

Deontic modality may be roughly dividend into commissive, directive and volitive.


table:type of deontic modality|meaning
commmissive|commital to something
directive|commands, requests, etc.
volitive|wishes, desires etc.

###### directive

table:type of directive modality|meaning
Permissive|something is permitted
Imperative|command
Hortative|encouraging/discouraging an action
Prohibitive/vetative|that something is prohibited.
Propositive|proposal or suggestion.
Propositive|that something should be brought about.

###### volitive

table:type of volitive modality|meaning
Desiderative|one has a desire for something
Optative|event is hoped for

##### epistemic

Mirative is an epistemic modality indicating surprise/unpreparedness in relation to a given thing
Causative is an epistemic modality indicating that someone/thing causes someone/thing else to do/be something.
Causative modality increases the valency of the verb involved.

## others

### honorific

A honorific is a grammatical feature that encodes social relationships.
Honorifics may encode formality, social distance, politeness, humillity, deference, or respect, depending on the language.
Honorifics may be realized via a variety of linguistic devices.

#### T-V

The T-V distinction (wide) is a honorific distinction realized in pronouns.
The T-V distinction (narrow) is a honorific distinction realized in two different second-person pronouns.
The T-V distinction is common in many Indo-European languages, but not english.
The name T-V distinction comes from latin tu/vos.

### polarity

Polarity is a grammatical feature that encodes the difference between positive and negative polarity.
Positive polarity may correspond to validity/truth/confirmation and negative polarity may corespond to falsity/denial.
Positive polarity = affirmation
Negative polarity = negation

# morphology

Morphology is the branch of grammar that studies morphemes and morheme combinations.
A morpheme is the smallest unit of language that corresponds to a sememe or grammeme.
Morphs as etic units are various phonological realization of the morphemes.
⟮Morphology⟯ generally deals with the ⟮phonology⟯ and not ⟮orthography⟯ of morphs/morphemes, as s⟮peech is more basic to language than writing⟯. 
The word ⟮unbreakable⟯ consists of the morpheme ⟮un, break, able.⟯ 
⟮Morphs⟯ and ⟮morphemes⟯ are generally written in ⟮curly braces {⟯}. 
{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /}}} are all ⟮allomorphs⟯ of {{c19::the morpheme {s} (plural s)
A null/zero morpheme is a morpheme that has no phonetic form/realization.
The root is the irreducable morphological core of a lexeme.

## things

### free and bound forms

A free morpheme is one that can stand on its own as a word.
A bound morpheme is one that only appears as part of a larger word.

## processes

### reduplication

Reduplication is the process in which a morpheme is repeated within a single word

### attaching stuff

#### affixes

Affixes are bound morphemes attached to the stem for word formation.
A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached.

##### use

Depending on what they're used for, affixes may be inflectional or derivational.
Inflectional affixes are those attached for inflection.
Derivational affixes are those attached for morphological derivation.

##### position

Depending on their position, affixes may be an adfix, infix or circumfix (and less common ones too).
An adfix is an affix that goes before or after the stem.
An adfix may be a prefix or suffix.
A circumfix is an affix that goes before and after the stem.
An infix is an affix inserted into the stem.

##### genesis.

A ⟮libfix⟯ is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮bound morpheme affix⟯ created by ⟮back-formation⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮libfixes⟯

#### clitics

Clitics are bound morphemes that acts like a word in certain syntactic properties, and like an affix in that it can't stand on its own, though the boudnaries are somewhat fuzzy.
The thing that a clitic attaches to is its host.
When something is being attached as a clitic, it is ⟮cliticising⟯
```lang=text;
It☞'s☜ a boy!
I☞'m☜ terribly sorry.
The queen☞'s☜ balls.
I haven☞'t☜ the faintest.
Senatus Populus☞que☜ Romanus
``` 
Enclitic   A clitic that appears after its host
Mesoclitic   A clitic that appears between the stem of the host and other affixes
Proclitic   A clitic that appears before its host

## use: Word formation

Word formation is the creation of new words.
Word formation may either be lexcreation or inflection.

### lexcreation

Lexcreation (my term) is word formation as the creation of new lexemes.
Lexcreation may be morphological or not.

#### morphological

Morphological lexcreation is lexcreation via morphology.
Morphological lexcreation may be compounding or morphological derivation

##### morphological derivation

Morphological derivation is morphological lexcreation by adding or removing affixes.
A derivate is a word created via derivation.

##### hybrid words

A hybrid word is a morphological derivation that derives from at least two different languages. 
The most common ⟮hybrid words⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived part⟯
e.g. asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)

##### compounds

Compounding is morphological lexcreation by creating compounds.
A compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one compound parts.
A compound part (my term) is a former lexeme that becomes a part of a compound.

###### finding the maning

The head of a compound is the lexeme that is being modified by the other lexemes in the compound.
An endocentric compound is one where the head indicates basic type of thing, all other compound parts describe the head
An exocentric compound is one where the compound parts all describe aspects some sort of unexpressed thing
A copulative compound is one where the sememe is the intersection of the sememes compound parts (or roughly so).
An appositional compound is supposedly different from a copulative compound, but I don't see it.
A dvandva is another name for a copulative/appositional compound.
If the english word for siblings was a copulative compound and we believed in the gender binary, it would be brothersister.


table:name|example
endocentric|smalltalk
exocentric|white-collar, scarecrow
copulative|bittersweet, sleepwalk

###### english

In english, ⟮compounds⟯ can be open, closed or hyphenated.
An open/closed compound is a compound containing/not containing a spacce.
In english, ⟮compounds⟯ generally ⟮progress from open to closed⟯, sometimes ⟮with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.⟯ 
e.g. "To day" → "to-day" → "today"

#### nonmorphological

Nonmorphological lexcreation is derivation that does not directly/completely use morphology.

##### abbreviation

An abbreviation is nonmorphological lexcreation by shortening a word.

###### acronym

An acronym is a type of abbreviation formed from the first letters of other words.
e.g. ATM = automated teller machine; SIA = singapore international airlines
Initialism = alphabetism
An initialism is an acronym which is pronounced as individual letters.
Sometimes initialism is just a synonym for acronym.

####### backronym

A backronym is a word that originally was not an acronym but is turned into one.
Examples of backgronyms: SAD ("seasonal affective disorder"), SOS ("Save Our Souls")
More recent examples include the brand name Adidas, named after company founder Adolf "Adi" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sport"; Wiki, said to stand for "What I Know Is", but in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase wiki-wiki meaning "fast"; or Yahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth" (taken from Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels).

###### numeronym

A numeronym is a word based on/using numbers.
Most commonly, a numeronym (a number based on/using numbers) is an abbreviation.
Numeronyms as abbreviations frequently either count the amount of letters in a word, have the numbers stand for words thus forming a weird abbreviation, or use the number metonymically.
Examples for numeronums: 9/11 (date metonym), i18n (letter count), 4649 (weird syllablecronym)

####### instances

table:numeronym|meaning
a11y|accessibility
g11n|globalization
p13n|personalization
i18n|internationalization

#### both/either-or

##### portmanteus

A splinter is a part of a lexeme that is not a morph.
e.g. both 'm' (from 'motor(ist)') and 'otel' (from 'hotel') in motel are splinters.
The terms portmanteu and blends are mixed to the point of confusion, ergo I will use neither.
A portmanteu word is a lexcreation where parts of multiple words are combined into a new word/morph.
A blend word is a portmanteu word where at least one part is a splinter.
A portmanteu morph is the merging of multiple morphs into one morph.
For example, -t in spanish might be a portmanteu morph of the morph for 3rd person and for singular.
took may be considered a portmanteu morph of take + ed.

##### clipping

Clipping may also be called truncation or shortening.
Clipping is lexcreation by removing some segments (be those syllables, morphs, phones...) of a lexeme, but retaining the original meaning.
e.g. Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu
Clipping is different from back-formation in that other things than morphemes can be clipped away and that back-formation may change the sense and/or word class.
Clipping is also different from back-formation, which proceeds by (pseudo-)morpheme rather than segment, and where the new word may differ in sense and word class from its source.

#### productivity

productivity is the degree to which native speakers of a language use a particular process in lexcreation.
The polar ends of productivity are productive and unproductive.
Lexcreation processses that are applied very infrequently are likely unproductive.
In english, using ablauts to create preterite verbs is unproductive, while using -ed to create preterite verbs is productive.

### inflection

Inflection is word formation via the modification of a lexeme to indicate one or more grammemes.
The stem is the morpheme that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections.
An invariable/invariant word is a word that cannot be inflected.

#### declension and conjugation

Inflection can be subdivided into ⟮declension and conjugation⟯
⟮Conjugation⟯ is inflection of ⟮verbs⟯
⟮Declension⟯ is inflection of ⟮nouns or adjectives⟯

#### agreement

Agreement is inflection caused by other words (or similar) in the sentence.

#### Inflectional paradigm

An »inflectional paradigm« is the complete set of forms that a class of words can assume ⟮when inflecting⟯
A »⟮typical inflectional paradigm⟯« (my term) is an inflectional paradigm that is used by a set of words selected by a well-defined criterion (e.g. based on how it ends)
An inflectional category is the subset of elements of a inflection paradigms that all realize a common grammatical feature category.
The inflectional category set (my term) is the set of inflectional categories that exist realizing a common grammatical feature category.
e.g. case, number
A lexeme is defective if it lacks some of the forms of its inflectional paradigm.
beware is a verb that is defective, as we can see by the fact that we can't say she bewares (of) the dog.
A lexeme is regular/irregular if it has/does not have a typical inflectional paradigm.
A verb class is one of the typical inflectional paradigms for verb.


## analysis

A surface analysis is a valid analysis of a lexeme's morphology no matter if etymologically true.
Surface analysis and all derivative terms are most frequently used to describe thereby resultant word formation.
Reanalysis is surface analysis into a different morphology than it originally had.
Juncture loss is reanalysis where an article and a noun fuse.
Juncture loss: al + chemy (from arabic) → alchemy
Rebracketing is also sometimes known as resegmentation or metanalysis
rebracketing is reanalysis into a different set of morphemes, but still a set
rebracketing: hamburger as ham + burger instead of hamburg + er
a folk etymology (or similar) is an etymology that is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation
folk etymology may be used as a synonym to reanalysis, but this is confusing, so I won't
Synonyms: folk etymology, fake etymology, false etymology, pseudoetymology

## typology

Morphological typology is linguistic typology according to a language's morphology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.

### analytic, synthetic

Analytic languages contain very little inflection and thus have very few (often close to 1) morphemes per word 
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.

# grammar + other fields

## + pragmatics

### interrogative word

An interrogative word or particle is a word used to create a kind of interrogative sentence.
Interrogative words are generally not their own part of speech, but instead fall into the category of other parts of speech.
An interrogative particle is a type of inerrogative word that converts a statement into a yes-no question.

## + semantics

### posessive

A posessive is a word or form indicating poession,
Many languages (of those I speak: en, de, es) indicate a posessive via a set of possessive determiners and pronouns.
Many languages also have a posessive verb, e.g. en/de have/haben, es tener.
In japanese, the job of the posessive verb is done by extential verbs/clausees.


### numerals

A numeral is a word or phrase that describes a numerical quantity.
Numerals may be seen as their own part, or as an abstract concept that may be instantiated by different parts of speech.
Across languages, numerals seem to be able to act as nouns, pronouns or adverbs.
Numerals are generally based on one or more counting systems.
In linguistics, measure words are words (or morphemes) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate a semantically qualified amount.
There are different kind of numerals (whether realized as words or phrases): 
ordinal numerals|position in sequence
cardinal numerals|amount/quantity
multipliers|
distributive numerals|
collective numerals|
Numerals are typically constructed via a counting system.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases, and stop counting every power of 10 at different numbers: most commonly at 1000 or at 10 000 (myriad)
due to the practice of wrapping at 10 000, 10 000 is used in many sinosphere languages to mean a lot, and most commonly 10k years = a long life.

#### japanese

In japanese grammar, measure words are typically called counters.
In japanese grammar, measure words are required for any numeral and when asking for quantities.
In japanese grammar, numerals, measure words and optional indicators for cardinality form a phrase (which I will call Counter Phrase).
Japanese 'counter phrases' can function in various syntactic ways: They can become no-adjectives, be used adverbially or postpositionally.

The japanese counting system:
rational-number ::= [マイナス]‹positive-rational-number›
positive-rational-number ::- ‹integer›[　点（てん）‹digit›{‹digit›}]
integer ::= {‹myriad-unit›}[‹place›][‹place›][‹place›]‹place-when-base-1›
myriad-unit ::= [‹place›][‹place›][‹place›]‹place-when-base-multiple-of-four›
place ::= ‹digit›‹base-word›
place-when-base-1 ::= ‹digit›
place-when-base-multiple-of-four ::= ‹digit›‹base-multiple-of-four-word›

Japanese digits:

0|零・丸・ゼロ


1|一|いち|ひと
2|二||ふた
3|三||みっ
4|四||よ(ん・っ)
5|五||いつ
6|六||むっ
7|七||なな
8|八||やっ
9|九||ここの

Japanese bases up to 1000

10|十|じゅう|とお
100|百|ひゃく|もも
1000|千|せん|ち

Japanese base when multiple of four words:

10^4|万|まん|よろず
10^8|億|おく|none
10^12|兆|ちょう|none

Counters

日|か|days|訓 (exception 一日：ついたち)


### demonstratives

demonstrative determiners usually map onto the spatial/discourse deixis distinction
Demonstratives usually come in two flavors, demonstrative determiners and demonstrative pronouns, which may or may not be derminers depending on your theory.

proximal|this
medial/distal|that
distal (rare)|yon(der)

proximal|este, estos|esta, estas|esto
medial|ese, esos|esa, esas|eso
distal|aquel, aquellos|aquella, aquellas|aquello

Neuter forms do not change for number.

#### Japanese

In japanese, the deictical distinction comes in form of morphemes, which form a large set of demonstratives with other morphemes.
The japanese deictical morphemes collectively are known as こそあど.

proximal|こ
medial|そ
distal|あ
question|ど

demonstrative determiner|~の
demonstrative pronoun (things)|~れ

the demonstrative determiners この、その… are originally abbreviations of これの、それの….

## linguistic error

Speech (production) error = mistake
Mistakes and errors are both unintentional deviation from the grammar of a languoid.
An error is a deviation from the grammar of a languoid that is caused by lack of knowledge about the grammar of the languoid.
A mistake is a deviation from the grammar of a languoid that is merely an error in performance, and would ordinarily not have happened.
Typically, only L2 speakers make errors, while anyone can make mistakes.
Errors may also lead to language change.
