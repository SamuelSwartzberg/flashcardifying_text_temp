## numeral system 

### positional

#### largest numbers

the largest possible number in a number of n digits of a given positional numeral system is base^n - 1
quick referene
8-bit binary|255

#### in programming

in programming, the base of the number is often indicated by a prefix

0b|binary|pretty much all programming languages
0|octal|JS (non-strict)
0o|octal|JS both strict and nonstrict

#### systems

##### binary

nth digit|value
1|1
2|2
3|4
4|8
5|16
6|32
7|64
8|128

###### signed numbers

In computing, at the binary level, negative numbers cannot be represented by prefixing a minus sign, therefore one needs a different way to indicated signedness.
There are three common ways to indicated signedness: one's complement, two's complement, sign and maginitude representation.
Today, two's complement is by far the most common way to indicate signedness of integers.
The problem with using sign bits is that there is both +0 and -0.
one's complement is the result of performing bitwise NOT on a number.
the two's complement is the one's complement + 1
Sign and maginitude representation is using a sign bit to represent signedness.
A sign bit is an extra bit that says whether a number is positive or negative.
Generally, the most siginificant bit is used as the sign bit.
Generally, for negative numbers, the sign bit is set, for positive numbers it is nunset.

##### hex

In hexadeximal, to represent digits beyond 9, a-f are used.

#### conv

##### dec-hex

Parity is the property of being even or odd.
Something has a parity of even if it is divisible by two, and odd otherwise.
A number in a positional numeral system will be even if its final digit is even.

# Geometry

## analytic

analytic geometry = catesian geometry
analytic geometry is the study of geometry using a coordinate system.

### coordinate sys

The origin is the point where the axes in a cartesian coordinate system intersect


# number theory

## properties

In mathematics, the sign of a real number is its property of being either positive, negative, or zero.
A signed number is a number which can have its sign specified.
Therefore, in computing a number is signed if it can take on negative values, and unsigned otehrwise.

## elementary arithmetic

# discrete mathematics

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" rather than "continuous".

## combinatorics

the factorial is indicated by !
Factorials make sense for non-negative integers.
The factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 

## sets

tuples use parentheses

### combination

A combination is an unordered subset of a given set.

### permutation

A permutation is an arrangement of a set in a certain order.
The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial.

### monotonic

A function is monotonic if for all x_1, x_2: 
montonically increasing|non-decreasing, weakly increasing|x_1 ≤ x_2 also f(x_1) ≤ f(x_2)
strictly (montonically) increasing|increasing|x_1 < x_2 also f(x_1) < f(x_2)
montonically decreasing|non-decreasing, weakly decreasing|x_1 ≤ x_2 also f(x_1) ≥ f(x_2)
strictly (montonically) increasing|increasing|x_1 < x_2 also f(x_1) > f(x_2)

a function is monotonic if it is monotonically increasing or monotonically decresing
a function is strictly monotonic if it is strictly monotonically increasing or stricly monotonically decresing

# algebra

In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 

## arguments


The arity of something specifies how many operands or arguments are involved. 
Arity is a property of operations or functions.
arity and adicity are rough synonyms
The arity is specified in latinate numbers
adicity is specified in greek-derived numbers.
adicity: monadic, dyadic, triadic, tetradic, pentadic, hexadic...
there is an adicity for every arity.
A function with an arity of 1 takes one argument.
A ternary operator takes 3 operands.
(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)add has an arity of {{c1::4}}
Something with indefinite arity is called {{c1::variadic}}

A n-ary function takes n arguments.
3+6=9 is a binary operation.

## units

A metric prefix aka SI prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or submultiple of the unit. 
All metric prefixes used today are decadic. 
A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes bits/bytes to indicate a multiple or submultiple.
When contrasted with binary prefixes, metric prefixes may also be known as decimal prefixes.
Binary prefixes are base-2, most commonly multiples of 1024.
binary-prefix-symbol ::= <metric-prefix-symbol>i
binary-prefix-name ::= <metric-prefix-name-first-2-chars>bi
Sometimes, metric(=decimal) prefixes are used as binary prefixes, however this is incorrect usage 
metric/decimal prefixes refer to increases of 1000, even when used on bits or bytes.
