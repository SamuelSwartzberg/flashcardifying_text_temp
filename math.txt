# notation

## numeral system 

A number consists of n digits.
a digit is a single symbol.


### positional

A positional numeral system differentiates the contribution of digits to the value of the number based on the index of their position within a number.
In a positional numeral system, the value of a digit is digitvalue*base^{index of position}
In a positional numeral system, the rightmost position has an index of 0.
a given positional numeral system with a base b has b-1 unique digits.
In a positonal numeral system, the digits are designed such that they increase in value by 1 starting from 0.
A number written using a positional numeral system is said to be written in positional notation.
In a positional numeral system, once a certain digit has reached its maximum value and one more is added, the digit is reset and one is added to the digit on the left.

Octal|8
Decimal|10
Hexadecimal|16
Vigesimal|20


#### sigfigs

significant figures are a function of a positional numeral system.
figures ≈ digits
zero is a digit prone to being insignificant.
Leading zeroes are always insiginficant.
trailing zeroes are insignificnat if they are not an indicator of precision.

The most significant digit is the one with the the highest exponent value.
The least signficcant digit has the one with the lowest exponent value.

In normal positional numeral notation, the leftmost digit is the most significant.
In normal positional numeral notation, the rightmost digit is the least significant.

#### endianness

Endianness is the order of most/least significant byte relative to the memory adress.
least significant byte|byte that represents the lowest value
most signifcant byte|byte that represents the highest value

big-endian|most significant byte is at smallest memory address
little-endian|least significant byte is at smallest memory address.

If we write memory addresses from left to right, as is usual, then arabic numerals would be big endian.

Modern processors are all little endian, the internet is big-endian.

#### largest numbers

the largest possible number in a number of n digits of a given positional numeral system is base^n - 1

#### in programming

in programming, the base of the number is often indicated by a prefix

0b|binary|pretty much all programming languages
0|octal|JS (non-strict)
0o|octal|JS both strict and nonstrict

###### bits and bytes

⟮c:9;a byte⟯ ⟮c:11;traditionally⟯ ⟮c:10;contains 8 bits⟯, ⟮c:11;though there are rare variant definitions⟯. 
unambiguously, ⟮c:12;8 bits⟯ are called ⟮c:13;an octet⟯. 
⟮c:14;4 bits⟯ are called ⟮c:15;a nibble⟯ (coined ⟮c:16;s:gb;by analogy to byte⟯). 
a ⟮c:1;16⟯-⟮c:2;bit⟯ aggregation ⟮(c:1;2⟯ ⟮c:2;bytes⟯, ⟮c:1;4⟯ ⟮c:2;nibbles⟯) may be called a ⟮c:4;s:3;hexadectet::h...⟯ (short: ⟮c:3;s:4;hextet::h...⟯ ) 
a ⟮c:5;16⟯-⟮c:6;bit⟯ aggregation ⟮(c:5;2⟯ ⟮c:6;bytes⟯, ⟮c:5;4⟯ ⟮c:6;nibbles⟯) may be called a ⟮c:8;s:7;quad-nibble::q...⟯ (short: ⟮c:7;s:8;quibble::q...⟯ ) 

###### signed numbers

In computing, at the binary level, negative numbers cannot be represented by prefixing a minus sign, therefore one needs a different way to indicated signedness.
There are three common ways to indicated signedness: one's complement, two's complement, sign and maginitude representation.
Today, two's complement is by far the most common way to indicate signedness of integers.
The problem with using sign bits is that there is both +0 and -0.
one's complement is the result of performing bitwise NOT on a number.
the two's complement is the one's complement + 1
Sign and maginitude representation is using a sign bit to represent signedness.
A sign bit is an extra bit that says whether a number is positive or negative.
Generally, the most siginificant bit is used as the sign bit.
Generally, for negative numbers, the sign bit is set, for positive numbers it is nunset.

##### hex

In hexadeximal, to represent digits beyond 9, a-f are used.
A hex digit is equivalent to 4 binary digits

#### conv

Parity is the property of being even or odd.
Something has a parity of even if it is divisible by two, and odd otherwise.
A number in a positional numeral system will be even if its final digit is even.

# Geometry

## analytic

analytic geometry = catesian geometry
analytic geometry is the study of geometry using a coordinate system.

### coordinate sys

The origin is the point where the axes in a cartesian coordinate system intersect

## angle

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Two_rays_and_one_vertex.png
An angle is the figure between two rays sharing a common endpoint.
The vertex of an angle is the common endpoint of the rays.
If we look at the two rays forming an angle as being in two planes, then an angle is the the figure formed by the intersection of these two planes.
A dihedral angle is the angle formed by the intersection of two planes at a line.
The measure of an angle is often also called an angle.
An angle (the measure) is the ratio of the length of the circular arc centered at the vertex that maps one of the rays into the other to the distance between the vertex and the intersection between the circular arc and one of the rays (the radius).

### kinds

An obtuse angle is greater than 90° and smaller than 180°
An acute angle is smaller than 90°

## measure

A measure is the indication of the size of something.

## shapes

### circle

A circular arc is the arc of a circle between a pair of distinct points.

# number theory

Number theory is the branch of maths concerned with the sudy of integers.
Number theory was/is often also called arithmetic/higher arithmetic.

## properties

In mathematics, the sign of a real number is its property of being either positive, negative, or zero.
A signed number is a number which can have its sign specified.
Therefore, in computing a number is signed if it can take on negative values, and unsigned otehrwise.
two real numbers are commensurable if their ratio is a rational number.
all rational numbers are by definition ocommensurable.

## factorization

{{c1::Integer factorization}} is the {{c2::decomposition}} of an {{c2::integer}} (specifically {{c2::composite number}}) into {{c3::a product of smaller integers}}.
a composite number is a natural number that is the product of two smaller natural numers
any positive integer > 1 is either a composite number or a prime number.
Prime factorization is a subtype of integer factorization.
Prime factorization is the decomposition of an integer into a product of prime numbers.
Generating composite numbers is trivial, but there is no known efficient algorithm for integer factorization.
Thus, integer factorization is essential to most modern cryptography.

## elementary arithmetic

elementary arithmetic is often just called arithmetic
elementary arithmetic is the set of the operations {addition, subtraction, multiplication, division}
operation|1st operand|2nd operand|result
addition|addend/summand|addend/summand|sum
subtraction|minuend|subtrahend|difference
multiplication|||product

### ops on sequences of numbers

The index of summation/multiplication is the bound variable used in Σ/Π-notation.
index of summation/multiplication is also called indexing variable.
the indexing variable together with its lower bound/limit is denoted as a subscript of Σ/Π-notation.
the upper bound/limit of the indexing variable is denoted as a superscript of Σ/Π-notation.
The thing on the right of Σ/Π-notation is the element being added/multiplied.

### multiplication

A product of a sequence of numbers is denoted by Π.

### addition

A summation is the addition of a sequence of numbers.
A summation is denoted by Σ.

#### digit sum

digit sum = quersumme
The digit sum is the sum of all the digits of a number.
e.g. digit sum of 9045<sub>10</sub> = 9 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 18.

### algorithms for

Doing elementary aritmetic manually is known as long x or x by hand.
Doing elementary arithmetic manually is known as schriftlich x in germann
If while doing subtraction by hand, if the subtrahend is bigger than the minuend in any collumn, you need to borrow one from the left.

übertrag = carry
a borrow is the oposite of a carry.
A carry is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b + 1
A borrow is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b - 1

## prime number

prime factor = primfaktor
A semiprime/biprime is a product of exactly two prime numbers
A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by one and itself (is not a product of two smaller natural numbers)
In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, numbers are stacked vertically, right aligned, separated from the result by a horizontal bar
In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, addition is done of individual digits from right to left, with carries or borrows as necessary.

### by hand

# discrete mathematics

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" rather than "continuous".

## combinatorics

the factorial is indicated by !
Factorials make sense for non-negative integers.
The factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 

## sets

tuples use parentheses

### diagrams

#### euler

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/EulerDiagram.svg

In an euler diagram, each shape represents a set S.
In an euler diagram, the area outside of a shape representing set S represents S^C
In an euler diagram, a shape s1 within another shape s2 indicates s1 ⊂ s2
In an euler diagram, two shapes s1, s2 not overlapping indicates they are disjoint
In an euler diagram, two shapes s1, s2 overlapping indicates they have an intersection.
In an euler diagram, the overlapping area of  s1, s2 indicates their intersection.

#### venn

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Venn_diagram_gr_la_ru.svg

A venn diagram (in contrast to an euler diagram) shows all possible logical relationship between different sets.
In a venn diagram, each shape represents a set S.
In a venn diagram, all possible overlappings of all shapes are present.
In a venn diagram, an element being within a shape indicates that it is an element of the relevant set, ergo an element being within an overlap indicates that it is in both sets.
In a venn diagram, if an area of overlap has no elements, it is often blacked-out.
In a venn diagram, instead of placing elements, it instead can be used to indicated WFF (TODO check if this is the right term) by highlighting the areas which fall under it.

### types of sets

#### number sets & blackboard bold

A <dfn>⟮c:15;number set⟯</dfn> is ⟮c:16;a set of numbers⟯ with ⟮c:17;certain special properties⟯, e.g. ⟮c:18;natural, rational, real etc⟯. 
⟮c:19;number sets⟯ are usually written in ⟮c:20;bold⟯ or ⟮c:20;blackboard bold⟯ letters. 
⟮c:21;number sets⟯ are called ⟮c:22;Zahlenbereiche⟯ in German. 


⟮c:23;Blackboard bold⟯ is a style of font that includes ⟮c:24;double⟯ ⟮c:25;vertical/near-vertical⟯ ⟮c:26;lines⟯ 
⟮c:27;𝔸, 𝔹, ℂ⟯ are examples for ⟮c:28;Blackboard bold⟯ (letters) 
⟮c:29;Blackboard bold⟯ letters are called ⟮c:30;Buchstaben mit Doppelstrich⟯ in German. 
⟮c:31;Blackboard bold⟯ letters are ⟮c:32;called that and look like that⟯ because ⟮c:33;drawing true bold letters on a blackboard would have been too time-consuming.⟯

### combination

A combination is an unordered subset of a given set.

### permutation

A permutation is an arrangement of a set in a certain order.
The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial.

### functions

A function in math is a relationship between two sets, the domain and the codomain.
A function assigns an element of the codomain to each element of the domain. (this however does not imply that each element of the codomain is aassigned to an element of the domain, there may be unassignemd elements)
functions are most often indicated by the letter f and beyond.
the value a function yields for a given element of the domain x is often denoted by f(x).
The element of the codomain that a function yields for a specific element of the domain x is often represented by y.
The graph of the function is the set of all pairs (x, f(x)) (equivalently: (x,y)).
The graph of a function ccan be used to draw a diagram of it, often confusingly and somewhat improperly also called graph.
The {{c1::value(s)}} that {{c2::must be provided}} to a {{c3::function}} to {{c4::obtain its result}} is/are known as {{c5::the/an argument(s)}}
A mathematical {{c1::function}} must take {{c3::one or more}} {{c2::arguments}}

#### notation

f(x) is read <q>f of x</q> in english
f(x) is read <q>f von x</q> in german

#### sets

the image of a function is the subset of the codomain that represents all values f(x) the function can produce
the image of a subset of x is the subset of the codomain that represents all values f(x) (for the subset of x) the function can produce
the preimage of a function is the subset of the domain that that map onto values that are part of the image.

#### jective

injective, surjective, bijective function = injection, surjection, byjection
an injective function maps each x to a distinct f(x), i.e. f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2.
a surjective function has at least one mapping that produces y (for every y, there is an x such that f(x) = y.
a bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective.
In other words, a bijective function maps exactly one element of a set to exactly one element of another set.

#### inverse

the inverse of a function f is a function that undoes the operation of f
the inverse of a function f only exists if f is bijective
the inverse of a function f is denoted by f^{-1}

#### monotonic

A function is monotonic if for all x_1, x_2: 
montonically increasing|non-decreasing, weakly increasing|x_1 ≤ x_2 also f(x_1) ≤ f(x_2)
strictly (montonically) increasing|increasing|x_1 < x_2 also f(x_1) < f(x_2)
montonically decreasing|non-decreasing, weakly decreasing|x_1 ≤ x_2 also f(x_1) ≥ f(x_2)
strictly (montonically) increasing|increasing|x_1 < x_2 also f(x_1) > f(x_2)

a function is monotonic if it is monotonically increasing or monotonically decresing
a function is strictly monotonic if it is strictly monotonically increasing or stricly monotonically decresing

#### zero

Zero = null = root
Nullstelle = zero/null/root
The zero is the point at which the graph of a function touches or intersects with the x-axis
Per definition, any zero x has the property f(x)=0

# analysis

## limits

a limit is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.
lim is an unary operator which gets the limit of an entity.
the limit of a function f(x) as x goes to a certain value c is indicated by lim_{x→c} f(x)
the value of a limit  is indicated L.
Asymptotic analysis is a way of describing limiting behavior by approaching the limit infinitely closely.
If under asymptotic analysis the limit becomes a certain value, it is said to be asymptotically equivalent (or just asymptotic) to that value.
a function f(x) being asymtotically equivalent to a certain limit foo is indicated f(x) ~ foo.
so, for example for f(x) = x^2 + 3x at values of x close to infinity, 3x becomes irrelevant. hence f(x) ~ n^2
The asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as x andor y approach infinity.
The asymptote of a curve is also the tangent to the curve at a point in infinity.
horizontal asymptotes|is horizontal|x tends to infinity
vertical asymptotes|is vertical|y tends to infinity


big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their computational complexity (run time or space requirements) grow as the input size grows
Big O notation looks like O(n). 
Big O notation describes limiting behavior under asymptotic analysis.

## calculus

Calculus is the mathematical study of continous change.

### differential calculus

differential calculus is concerned with rate of change and slopes of curves

#### differentiation

A differentiable function is one whose derivative exists at every point of the domain.
The derivate of a function is the slope/gradient of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point
derivative is ableitung in german.

##### antiderivative

antiderivative = inverse derivative
An antiderivative is a differential function F whose derivative is equal to the original function f.
Antiderivatives satisfy F' = f.

### integral calculus

integral calculus is concerned with the accumulation of quantities and the areas under/between curves.

## real analysis

# algebra

In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 


## formulae

### Equation

f+o+o = b+a+r
An {{c1::equation}} is a statement that {{c3::asserts the equality}} of {{c2::two expressions}}
An {{c4::equation}} connects its {{c1::two}} {{c2::expressions}} via {{c3::an equals sign}}

## expressions

An {{c1::expression}} in math is {{c2::a well-formed combination of mathematical symbols (e.g. numbers, variables, operations, functions, brackets, etc.)}} including {{c3::at least one operator}}


## operations

An operation is a function which takes zero or more input values and produces a well-defined output value.
In an operation, the zero or more input values are known as operands.
In an operation, the symbol performing the operation is an operator.
In 3+4, 3 and 4 are the operands.
In 3+4, + is the operator.
We might want to consider a constant to be an operation of arity 0.

### types

#### elementary

#### non-elementary

##### exponentiation

exponentiation is a mathematical operation which is written as b^n and means \prod_{i=1}^{n}b
For an exponentiation b^n, b is called the base, and n is called exponent.
base ≈ radix
The logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation.
The logarithm of a number x is the exponent n that applied to a given base b would yield x.
If no base is given for a logarithm, it is obvious or doesn't matter.
The logarithm of x for a base b is denoted as \log_b(x) or \log_{b}x
log_b(b^n) = n

log_e = ln
natural logarithm: log_e

b^1 = b
b^0 = 1
b^-n = 1/(b^{-1})


### properties

#### idempotentitcity

A function/operation/etc. is ⟮c:1;idempotent⟯ if ⟮c:2;it can be applied mulitple times⟯ without ⟮c:3;changing the result⟯ ⟮c:4;beyond the initial application⟯. 
Examples for i⟮c:5;dempotent functions⟯ include ⟮c:1;abs(x), floor(x), ceil(x) etc.⟯

the ⟮c:6;right image⟯'s button is ⟮c:7;idempotent⟯, the ⟮c:6;left image⟯'s is ⟮c:7;not⟯ 

#### commutative

A commutative operation is one where changing the order of operands does not change the result.
Addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and dicvision are noncommutative.

#### associative

An associative operation is one where rearranging parenthesis will not change the result.
Addition and multiplication (if not mixed) are associative, subtraction and division are nonassociative.

#### distributive

an operation is distributive if it is both left- and right-distributive
left-distributive|ζ * (x+y) = (ζ * x) + (ζ * y)
right-distributive|(x+y) * ζ = (ζ * x) + (ζ * y)

### arguments


The arity of something specifies how many operands or arguments are involved. 
Arity is a property of operations or functions.
arity and adicity are rough synonyms
The arity is specified in latinate numbers
adicity is specified in greek-derived numbers.
adicity: monadic, dyadic, triadic, tetradic, pentadic, hexadic...
there is an adicity for every arity.
A function with an arity of 1 takes one argument.
A ternary operator takes 3 operands.
(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)add has an arity of {{c1::4}}
Something with indefinite arity is called {{c1::variadic}}

A n-ary function takes n arguments.
3+6=9 is a binary operation.

#### prefixes

##### SI prefix

A metric prefix aka SI prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or submultiple of the unit. 
All metric prefixes used today are decadic. 
A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes bits/bytes to indicate a multiple or submultiple.
When contrasted with binary prefixes, metric prefixes may also be known as decimal prefixes.
Binary prefixes are base-2, most commonly multiples of 1024.
binary-prefix-symbol ::= <metric-prefix-symbol>i
binary-prefix-name ::= <metric-prefix-name-first-2-chars>bi
Sometimes, metric(=decimal) prefixes are used as binary prefixes, however this is incorrect usage 
metric/decimal prefixes refer to increases of 1000, even when used on bits or bytes.
