japanese sometimes does adj + det + noun instead of det + adj + noun.
人気のあの子

っち as diminutive

Japanese distinguishes its existential verbs ある・いる along a inanimate/animate distinction.

Grammatically, counter words can appear either before or after the noun they count. They generally occur after the noun (following particles), and if used before the noun, they emphasize the quantity; this is a common mistake in English learners of Japanese. For example, to say "[I] drank two bottles of beer", the order is ビールを二本飲んだ bīru o nihon nonda (lit. "beer OBJECT two-long-thin-count drank"). In contrast, 二本のビールを飲んだ nihon no bīru o nonda (lit. "two-long-thin-count POSSESSIVE beer OBJECT drank") would only be appropriate when emphasizing the number as in responding with "[I] drank two bottles of beer" to "How many beers did you drink?".

Japanese has a morphological device to signify causation. Many verbs undergo internal change in various semiregular patterns between intransitive forms and causative transitive forms:

    agaru "to go up, to rise" → ageru "to raise"
    magaru "to turn" → mageru "to bend"

In the context of an intransitive verb, the syntax of Japanese causatives allows a two-way distinction in the causee's willingness to perform the action. If the new object is marked in the accusative case (o), it suggests that the causee did the action willingly, suggesting the agent allowed or requested the action rather than forcing or demanding it. However, if the object is marked in the dative case (ni), it expresses the idea that the causee was forced to perform the action. (This is not possible with a transitive verb as a clause cannot contain two noun phrases marked as accusative.)

In the Japanese encoding system JIS X 0208, there are a few kanji encoded that are not found in any kanji dictionary. These are commonly known as “ghost characters” (yuurei moji 幽霊文字).
The standard acknowledged the sources for these characters, but later people were unable to find these characters in the original sources. Later it was found that the encoded forms were wrong, and the forms that were supposed to be taken, were not encoded. Despite this, one character remains truly elusive, 55-27 彁 (U+5F41), its sources were not acknowledged and no results were found after extensive research. The character 彁 has since then become an internet phenomenon.

So what happened with the characters that were wrongly encoded? And what happened to the charcters that were not encoded?

The wrong characters are still there, because once a character is encoded, you can’t remove it. The correct characters were added later to different JIS code pages.
The most famous of such characters is 54-12 妛，which was a mistake for 𡚴。The source, when preparing the script for print, stuck two pieces of paper together for the 山 and 女 parts, but the gap in the paper created a mark in the print, and this was mistakenly spread as a vertical line in the middle. The right form 𡚴 was encoded in JIS X 0213.
Likewise, 52-63 壥 is believed to be a mistake of 㕓, but the correct form is still not in JIS X 0213.
For a more extreme case, 61-73 汢 was encoded for a place name, but the source character was wrong, and it should have had 冫instead of 氵。This character is still not even in Unicode. In 2002, the place that used this character officially changed their name to the form with 汢 for convenience.

 @RaymondHng  An Asahi Shimbun commentator claimed that he found 彁 in a paper from 1923, in the term「埼玉自彁會」，but it was picked up wrongly by the digitization program, and was supposed to be 彊 (see 自彊術). Now for sorting and convenience, the character 彁 is arbitrarily assigned the reading “ka” (from 哥) or “sei”.

unsolved-questions:
  ja:
    - Is トムだのだ。grammatically correct? (It's tom, explanatory.)
    - When your sentence ends in an I-adjectove, is it illegat to leave it unconjugated and add a form of the copula (eg. 私わかわいいでした。) Probably yes, because conjuating nouns and adjectives is infact just gluing on a copula, right?
    - 昨日、時間が___。
    - Are 食べるばかりじゃない andor 食べなかったばかり wrong?

Abstract: 

In the process of language evolution, some te-verb forms in Japanese have been converted into adverbial modifiers or complete adverbs for modifying predicates. The conversion from the verb to the adverbial modifier or to the adverb is a gradual process. On the basis of the previous researches, this paper takes「敢えて」,「極めて」,「初めて」,「改めて」,「好んで」and「目立って」as the research objects, and through the investigation of corpus to explore the evolution of te-verb forms to adverbial modifiers or adverbs in diachronic process from recent period to modern one. With the observation of the frequency and semantic changes, the degrees of adverbization of the research objects have been improved or reduced, and the conversion of word classes is a process of dynamic change.

って感じ
というnoun

Quick translation note: Page 9 had some Japanese puns that I thought were just untranslatable, so I did my best to sub in other puns, to mediocre results.
The bun on the right is actually a steamed bun filled with red bean, called an あんまん (anman). まん (man) also happens to mean “pussy,” such as in the word 手マン (teman), “finger-banging.”

The car on the left is a Ferrari, which in Japanese is spelled フェラーリ (ferāri). This coincidentally contains the word for “fellatio,” フェラ (fera).

I just heard そうなんかもね, which is interesting since it shows that の+かも is legitimate, and so probably also かな etc

When giving the ⟮location⟯ of something/one with ⟮ある⟯ or ⟮いる⟯, use ⟮に⟯ for the ⟮place⟯.
In general, the idea of targetness for に is ___  ⟮very general⟯ The 「⟮へ⟯」 particle is used to express the fact that one is setting out ⟮towards⟯ ＊the ＊⟮direction⟯ of the target. As a result, it is only used with directional motion verbs. It also does not guarantee whether the target is the ⟮final⟯ ⟮intended⟯ ⟮destination⟯, only that one is ⟮heading⟯ ⟮towards⟯ that ⟮direction⟯. What is the difference between に and へ as particles as concerns targeting?  ⟮に」 goes ＊to＊ a target as the final, intended destination, while へ only claims that one will go in the direction of the target⟯ When using ⟮へ⟯, the ⟮verb⟯ ⟮has to⟯ be one related to ⟮ physical direction⟯, the ⟮thing⟯ being marked ⟮does not have to⟯.<div class="sub"> <div class="sub c1-b c2-f" > but actually somewhat more complicated </div> </div>

It is a very broad category for people in workforce, although it literally means people who are part of society.  The term is often used in contrast to gakusei (学生), which means students. The precise definition of ___ does not really exist. For example, how should we categorize shufu (主婦) i.e., housewives? Housewives may not be in the workforce, but they do often play important functions for society, such as raising children. Using the broader categorization, you could also say housewives are ___ (as well as students who really are part of the society).  What's interesting is that the term is often used to mean that people become first-class citizens only after they start working and join the labor force. In that sense, the usage of the term connotes that non-____ like students and housewives are second-class citizens. </div> </div>

It is Japan's fourth-largest incorporated city and the third most populous urban area. Located on the Pacific coast on central Honshu, it is the capital of Aichi Prefecture and is one of Japan's major ports along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokohama, and Chiba. It is also the center of Japan's third-largest metropolitan region, known as the Chūkyō metropolitan area. As of 1 October 2019, 2,327,557 people lived in the city, part of Chūkyō metropolitan Area's 10.11 million people,[4] making it one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.  In 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. Nagoya was proclaimed a city in 1889, during the Meiji Restoration; it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area's automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished.[5] Nagoya was impacted by bombing from US air raids during World War II.  After the war, Nagoya developed into a major port and transport center. The Shinkansen high-speed line connecting Tokyo and Osaka converges on Nagoya. Nagoya is served by two airports: Chubu Centrair International Airport in nearby Tokoname, and Nagoya Airfield, home to Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Nagoya remains an important center for the automotive, aviation, and ceramic industries, hosting the headquarters of Brother Industries, Ibanez, Lexus, and Toyota Tsusho, among others.  Nagoya is home to Nagoya University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nagoya City University. It is also the location of numerous cultural institutions, including the Tokugawa Art Museum, Atsuta Shrine, Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Aichi Arts Center, and Misono-za. Nagoya TV Tower is the oldest TV tower in Japan. </div> </div>

Critics worry that girls involved in enjo-kōsai will grow up to be unfit wives and mothers. This perception arises from suspicions that when these girls are adults, they will quickly abandon their loyalties and commitments to their family for offers of money and material benefits.[6] However, certain feminist groups[which?] and critics regard enjo-kōsai as an empowering way to "undermine patriarchal models of propriety used to evaluate and control women".[This quote needs a citation] Control over their bodies and means to support themselves is a new kind of independence for these girls. Good women in Japan are supposed to be sensible, modest, nurturing and respectful, yet girls participating in enjo-kōsai clearly reject such virtues of female restraint and modesty in Japan. Feminists such as Chizuko Ueno point out that the accidental access of girls to this dating market was not a matter of ethics, but of probability.[6] Sooner or later, these girls and young women would, in a desire for financial independence, tap into this market for their own empowerment. However, Ueno points out that while engaging in enjo-kōsai may appear beneficial for young women in the short term, it also reinforces patriarchal power structures by leaving the notion that women's bodies exist to serve male desire unchallenged.[7] </div> </div>

### misc

Why is a na-adjective called a na-adjective?  Because you need to put a na between the adjective and the noun.
Since japanese is head-final, it's (‹i-adjective›|‹na-adjective›な)‹noun›
All i-adjectives end with い, hence their name.
WHile na-adjectives may end in い, this is generally within the kanji, but within 送り仮名 (however, exceptions exist, e.g. 嫌い).
In japanese, adjectives can be converted to adverbs via morphological derivation.
i-adjectives|-い+く
na-adjectives|+に

### relationships

⟮仮名⟯ is a term for ⟮any syllabary⟯ used to ⟮write japanese 音⟯, or ⟮a character from such a syllabary⟯. 
⟮仮名⟯ as a word is a compound of ⟮　仮（かり）⟯ '⟮c_;temporary, tentative, provisional⟯' + ⟮　名（な）⟯ '⟮name⟯', which got ⟮reduced to かんな⟯ and then ⟮just to かな⟯. 
In contrast, ⟮真名⟯ '⟮true name⟯' means ⟮漢字⟯, esp. ⟮when they are used for their meaning (i.e. not 万葉仮名 or 当て字).⟯

⟮真カタカナ⟯

⟮仮名⟯ systems where ⟮kanji are used to represent 音⟯ are known as ⟮真仮名⟯。 
⟮真仮名⟯ are similar to ⟮当て字⟯ today 
⟮　万葉仮名（まんようがな）⟯ was ⟮the most common form⟯ of ⟮真仮名⟯ 
⟮音仮名⟯ is a ⟮真仮名⟯ system where ⟮the 音読み of 漢字⟯ would be used to ⟮transcribe 和語⟯. 
Using ⟮音仮名⟯, ⟮やま⟯ might be spelled as ⟮　也（や）(y, that's the on of that kanji)末⟯ 
⟮訓仮名⟯ is actually insane. It's a ⟮真仮名⟯ system where ⟮the 訓読み of 漢字⟯ would be used to ⟮transcribe 和語⟯. 
Using ⟮訓仮名⟯, ⟮大和・やまと⟯ might be spelled as ⟮八間跡⟯. 

The ⟮first⟯ system of ⟮真仮名⟯ was ⟮　万葉仮名（まんようがな）.⟯ ⟮万葉仮名⟯ had developed by ⟮500ish⟯. 
In ⟮　万葉仮名（まんようがな）⟯ ⟮any 音⟯ could have been written with ⟮any 漢字 pronounced in the correct way.⟯ 


⟮　草書（そうしょ）⟯ is a style of kanji ⟮often falsely called⟯ ⟮grass style⟯, ⟮it really means⟯ ⟮cursive/rough style⟯. 
After it had evolved, ⟮　草書（そうしょ）⟯ became ⟮associated with feminity (In Japan⟯). 
⟮平仮名⟯ evolved ⟮from 　草書（そうしょ）⟯ in ⟮the 800s⟯. 
⟮平仮名⟯ ⟮also⟯ became ⟮associated with femininity⟯. 
Due to their association, ⟮both 　草書（そうしょ） and 平仮名⟯ became known as ⟮　女（おんな）　手（で）.⟯ 
Due to ⟮their gender association⟯, ⟮　草書（そうしょ） and 平仮名⟯became seen negatively. 
Even ⟮today⟯, ⟮平仮名⟯ are sometimes said to have ⟮a feminine quality⟯. 

⟮　楷（かい）　書（しょ）⟯ literally means '⟮regular/standard script⟯' 
Connected somehow to ⟮　草書（そうしょ）⟯ ⟮becoming associated with feminity⟯, ⟮　楷（かい）　書（しょ）⟯ ⟮became associated with masculinity⟯. 
⟮　楷（かい）　書（しょ）⟯ was, after ⟮the relevant gender associations had occurred⟯, also called ⟮　男（おとこ）　手（で）⟯ 

⟮c+;片仮名⟯ are derived from ⟮万葉仮名⟯ by ⟮taking part of the kanji⟯. 
⟮片仮名⟯ was developed by ⟮　奈良（なら）のbuddhist monks⟯ in ⟮the 800s⟯, and since then ⟮has stayed mostly the same⟯ 


⟮ひらがな⟯ and ⟮かたかな⟯ both ⟮developed from⟯ ⟮　万葉仮名（まんようがな）⟯ 
Due to ⟮the way they evolved via 　草書（そうしょ） from 　万葉仮名（まんようがな）⟯, there were many ⟮non-standard 平仮名⟯, both due to ⟮coming from different cursive styles⟯, or ⟮from different 　万葉仮名（まんようがな）.⟯ 
The ⟮now nonstandard 平仮名⟯ are called ⟮　変体仮名（へんたいがな）⟯. 
⟮　変体仮名（へんたいがな）⟯ were ⟮obsoleted by⟯ ⟮the 1900 script reform.⟯ 

⟮送り仮名⟯ are the ⟮hiragana dangling off the end⟯ of ⟮some words⟯.

Cursive variants of 漢字 have way less strokes than non-cursive variants.
Often, cursive variants of 漢字 are nearly illegible, even for native speakers.
However, cursive variants are very quick to write.
Cursive variants are generally generated by merging strokes.
The easiest/most common way to merge strokes for 漢字 is to merge dots into a single stroke.
The two scripts considered ⟮cursive⟯ are ⟮行書⟯ and ⟮草書⟯
　行書（ぎょうしょ） is less cursive compared to 　草書（そうしょ）.

All hanzi evolved from the original form that we still have, which is oracle bone script.

Today, the most general/standard way to write 漢字 is 　楷（かい）　書（しょ）

## pragmatics

Japanese backchannels are called 　相（あい）　槌（づち）.
　相（あい）　槌（づち） are quite common in japan.

## sociolinguistics

### official language

⟮There is no⟯ ⟮official national language⟯ of Japan. 
The ⟮de facto national language⟯ of Japan is ⟮standard Japanese (標準語/共通語⟯) 

### gender

Compared to most european langauges, japanese male and female registers (男性語・女言葉・女性語) are often characterized as More distinct/developed

### 山の手/下町

⟮山の手⟯/⟮下町⟯ first distinguished ⟮two areas⟯ in ⟮江戸⟯ ⟮west⟯ and ⟮east⟯ of ⟮the imperial palace⟯ respectively. 
The phyzsical geography of areas ⟮山の手⟯/⟮下町⟯ in 江戸 were ⟮the hills⟯ and ⟮the marshy valleys⟯ respecitvely. ⟮徳川 retainers⟯ lived in ⟮山の手⟯, ⟮the artisans and other non-aristocrats⟯ lived in ⟮下町⟯. 
Via ⟮the people living in⟯ ⟮山の手/下町⟯, these words then gained the association of ⟮high-class/low-class status⟯. 
The people living in ⟮山の手⟯ and ⟮下町⟯ ⟮spoke different dialects of japanese⟯. However, during ⟮Meiji-era⟯ ⟮linguistic standartization⟯ ⟮山の手-japanese⟯ became ⟮the model for the standard language,⟯ and so ⟮下町⟯ became ⟮mere dialect⟯. 
Both due to ⟮山の手 becoming standard japanese,⟯ and ⟮due to the association with 山の手 as high-status/class and 下町 as low-status/class⟯, ⟮山の手言葉⟯ became a ⟮high-prestige⟯ lect, and ⟮下町言葉⟯ became a ⟮low-prestige⟯ lect. 
Features of ⟮下町言葉⟯ are ⟮lack of distinction between ひ and し⟯⟮, ［ai］/［oi］ to ［eː］⟯ 

Bonus facts:
⟮江戸⟯ is ⟮the old name of 東京⟯. 
In the 江戸 period, ⟮下町⟯ sometimes referred to ⟮all of 江戸.⟯ 

## morphology

Japanese forms appositional compounds, which will generally not display 連濁.
e.g. 　山（やま・さん）　川（かわ・せん） for mountains and rivers = scenery and 　左（さ）　右（ゆう） for left and right = control.
Japanese endocentric compounds will generally display 連濁 if phonotactically possible.

### japanese stems

The stem that we most commonly call 'stem' in english is the 
stem of ru-verb is verb - る
Stem of u-verb is ‹consonant›u → ‹consonant›i

## sm grammic features

### by thing encoded


#### numerals

In japanese grammar, measure words are typically called counters.
In japanese grammar, measure words are required for any numeral and when asking for quantities.
In japanese grammar, numerals, measure words and optional indicators for cardinality form a phrase (which I will call Counter Phrase).
Japanese 'counter phrases' can function in various syntactic ways: They can become no-adjectives, be used adverbially or postpositionally.

The japanese counting system:
rational-number ::= [マイナス]‹positive-rational-number›

#### deixis

In japanese, the deictical distinction comes in form of morphemes, which form a large set of demonstratives with other morphemes.
The japanese deictical morphemes collectively are known as こそあど.

proximal|こ
medial|そ
distal|あ
question|ど

demonstrative determiner|~の
demonstrative pronoun (things)|~れ

the demonstrative determiners この、その… are originally abbreviations of これの、それの….

#### honorifics

Japanese has three dimensions of honorifics: politeness, formality, and deference/humility ＆ respect.
Politeness|relationship to addressee
Deference/humility ＆ respect|relationship between people in sentence
Formality|relationship to medium

https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68970/politeness-respectfulness-humility-formality

Language encoding politeness in japanese is called 丁寧語.
Politeness is encoded in verb/copular endings in japanese.
Any politeness marker in japanese is only allowed at the end of clauses
Deference/humility ＆ respect are encoded in different verbal conjugations, inflection of objects, and vocabulary choice.
Formality is encoded in different versions of the copula, as well as in certain word choices.

##### humility/respect

尊敬語|honorific
謙譲語|humble

To be polite, one uses honorific sm grammic features for the actions of others andor one's 外, and humble sm grammic features for oneself andor one's 内.
To be rude, one may use humble sm grammic features for the actions of others.
To be arrogant, one may use honorific sm grammic features for oneself.

尊敬語 conjugation: お連用形になる
謙譲語 conjugation: お連用形する

The passive may also be used as a light 尊敬語.
In fact, なさる and 下さる in fact come from なす ('to do')/下す and the passive・honorific suffix

Requests for honorific verbs that change りー＞い then often use the 命令形 of ます: ませ, just the 連用形 of the verb is also used.

## graphemics

In japanese, reduplication of a kanji is marked with 々.

### punctuation

Most logographic systemss as well as japanese do not use whitespace for punctuation.
In japanese, using a question mark is optional when ending a sentence with the interrogative particle か.

## phon

### phonetics

#### major class

##### liquids

Which phoneme the japanese liquid is is completely unclear:
Most commonly it is sait to be a  apico-alveolar tap [ɾ] or an alveolar lateral approximant [l], less commonly various combinations of alveolar, postalveolar or retroflex lateral or non-lateral approximant, tap or stop.

#### length

##### gemination

In japanese, gemination is marked by っ.
In japanese, non-phonemic gemination implies emphasis (not in all varieties though).
すごい → すっごい
In japanese, gemination typically only happens to unvoiced consonants (and vowels), voiced consonants only geminate if part of 外来語.
If gemination of voiced consonants happens as part of 外来語, they are often devoiced.

### phonology

#### suprasegmental

##### suprasegmentals

###### stress/tone

The pitch of a word rises until it reaches a downstep and then drops abruptly

##### units 

###### syllable

In japanese most syllables are open syllables, either CV or V.

#### changes in sound

##### elision/epenthesis

For example, the Japanese prefix ma- (真〜（ま〜）, pure …, complete …) transforms regularly to ma'- (真っ〜（まっ〜）, (gemination of following consonant)) when followed by a consonant, as in masshiro (真っ白（まっしろ）, pure white)

#### morphophonology

##### sandhi

Japanese exhibits two forms of sandhi, 連濁 and 連声.
連声 is the phenomenon that when a morpheme ending in ん and a morpheme beginning with a vowel collide, the second morpheme will instead begin /n‹vowel›/
てんおう → てんのう is an example of 連声

What sound do japanese non-moraic n-syllables produce? (e.g. なねにのぬ）  [n] (exept for ni, which of course procudes [n⎴j⎴i], which is more properly [ɲ̟i])


When can you devoice [i] or [u͍] (in japanese)?  ⟮inbetween two voiceless consonants, and after a voiceless consonant at the end of a word⟯
 ⟮ku̥⟯ ⟮next syllable starts with voiceless consonant, or end of word⟯ ⟮su̥⟯ ⟮next syllable starts with voiceless consonant, or end of word⟯
If two syllables are devoiceable in a row...  only the first one will devoice.

Instead of using spellings with ヴ, what do words often use?   Spellings with /b/, e.g. バ, ビ, etc.
When are spellings including ヴ used?  To emphasize that the word was spelled with V originally
ヴ   vu
ヴァ   va
ヴィ   vi
バイオリン   ヴァイオリン

ん・ン 
at the end of a word (and in isolation) [ɴ]
before dentals/alveolars/postalveolars [n]
before velars [ŋ]
before bilabials [m]
before dental affricates and itself  ɲ
before anything else  a nasal semivowel ɰ̃ (Basically [ɴ] without the uvular close)


Which consonant is not doubled by っ?  /n/


FF claims that [e]+い doesn't produce [ee] in two mora words, but I'm not sure about that


⟮Japanese and spanish⟯ ⟮[o], [e], [i]⟯ ⟮are quite similar⟯

## syntax

### semantics

#### requests

なさる is a 補助動詞 (attaching to the 連用形) that is used in the 連用形・ます imperative to make requests that sound firm but polite, like a teacher or parent
なさい(ませ) after the 連用形 to make requests may be shortened to な
くれる is a 補助動詞 attaching to the te-form that is used for making requests, most often in the negative.
下さる is a 補助動詞 attaching to the te-form that is used in the 連用形・ます imperative to make requests that are polite
for less polite requests, the て-form may also be used plainly.
The imperative itself is rarely used, because it is quite impolite.

### sentences

#### interrogative

question tags

ja|ね・な・でしょう・だろう|んじゃない・違う(?)

Japanese:
Japanese interrogative particles are sentence-final particles.

Any question|か
closed-ended questions|かい
open-end|だい

The japanese interrogative particle か is relatively implication-free when used with +polite construction, but has certain implications when used with -polite constructions.

### clauses

#### subordinate clauses

In japanese relative clauses are merely normal clauses placed attributively.
In japanese embeded questions are marked by the interrogative particle か.
In japanese, embedded questions may be suffixed by どうか or the alternative itself to indicate "whether or not".

### sm grammic features

#### phi-features

##### number

Japanese frequently does reduplication, mainly for the plural.

#### Evidentiality

Japanese has evidential morphemes, namely heresay and inferential evidentials, as Narrog and Yang (2018) argue.

Japanese inferential evidential morphemes are: そう、らしい、っぽい、よう、みたい

Within the japanese inferential evidentials, そう is different from the rest in that it is future-oriented.
The inferential evidential そう has a meanining in which it implies that there are two phases, one at a point in time 1, at which the state of affairs is not yet realized, and one at point in time 2, at which time it will be realized; the other evidentials do not.
e.g. それは美味しそう！ "that looks tasty" ⇒ It is not yet tasty (since we're not eating it), but when and if we eat it, it will be tasty.
this そう not for 可愛い 
The inferential evidential そう has a second meaning in which it indicates the inferred physical or mental state of a second or third person.
Of the other four inferential evidential markers っぽい、よう、みたい act broadly similarly

Japanese heresay evidential morphemes are: そう、らしい.

Beyond evidential markers, らしい can also indicate typicality (e.g. someone is some way based on their behavior), while よう may also be used for similarity, comparison, category membership and as a complementizer.

#### modality

Deontic
Deontic - directive

Deontic - voltive
Deontic - volitive: Desiderative
たい・たがる

Deontic - optative:
The Japanese optative is formed by using a conditional such as ba (-ば) or tara (-たら). For example, "I wish there were more time" is expressed literally as "If there were time, it would be good." (時間があればいいのに jikan ga areba ii noni), where aru, the verb expressing existence, is in the ba conditional form areba. Ii is the present tense of "good," but if expressed in the past tense yokatta よかった, the sentence expresses regret instead of a wish or hope. The above example would become "If there had been time, it would have been good" 時間があればよかったのに, as might be said of an opportunity missed because of a lack of time.

The optative mood can also be expressed by suffixing ように you ni to the verb, typically the polite form. For instance, "may you have a pleasant trip" 楽しい旅になりますように

Epistemic - irrealis
かな, かしら (female)、かも(しれない)

### Morphology

#### suffixes



Of nouns only, resulting construct is still noun:

だらけ|full of/riddled with (may be metaphorical)
塗れ|covered in/by (fluids, not metaphorical)
ずくめ|
めく|showing signs of


#### nominalizers

Japanese has three basic nominalizers: こと、もの、の
の|no special implication
もの|thing
こと|event
まま|state (lack of change)
Japanese nominalizers are suffixed to the attributive form of the relevant thing.

In japanese, the 連用形 can sometimes be used as a noun, in effect nominalizing it. Reversedly, nouns sometimes go in places where the 連用形 would normally, making these two a somewhat unified class

　方（ほう） (noun)|manner ('way of')

‹foo›方が‹bar›|foo is more bar
for ‹foo›方が‹bar›, using the past tense of a positive verb foo makes it more emphatic
　方（ほう）がいい|better, should


ということ|summarizing

##### gramamr where the thing is a noun

(た-form + )　途端（とたん）(に)|just as, the moment that (for things outside of the agents control)

連体形+挙句|negative result

#### complementizers

Most commonly, と acts as a complementizer in Japanese.
Things complemenentized by と may be actual quotes, direct or indirect or subordinate clauses.
For indirect quote, the sentence must have a pronounced verb/copula
The nominalizers often also act as complementizers.
と言う+nominalizer|generic complementizer ('that')
と言う+noun|noun that is called...
と言う意味|mean ...
と言う|say that, to be called that
と思う|think that
と考える|to consider that
と決める・決まる|decide/be decided that

と[verb][particles] = って

接続詞


#### between clauses

non-illiative ＆ non-adversative clausal coordination: verbal morphology て形 (informal), 連用形 (formal)

## phrases

### なる

なる = become
なる in kanji: 成る
‹adverbial›なる = become
‹adverbial›する = decide on
if と instead of に in adverbial, the change is sudden.
To get hooked on X: X｛が・は｝癖になる

### よる

the case particle より originally derives from the verb よる
よる (が)
因る, 由る|be based on
拠る|be based at
依る|depend on
依る, 拠る|to be caused by
寄る|approach, draw near; gather together, to meet, stop by; grow old, high, wrinkly; lean against, recline on
よる（を）
選る|choose, select

xによって; xによる|depending on x; by x; by dint of x
xによると|according to x

### ことがある

‹clause›こと‹kakari-joshi›‹form-of-aru›
‹clause-present-tense›こと‹kakari-joshi›‹form-of-aru›: Event sometimes happens/never happens
‹clause-past-tense›こと‹kakari-joshi›‹form-of-aru›: Event has happened/never happened

### must not

‹if-not›‹what-happens›
if-not::=なくては|なければ|ないと
what-happens::=negative of 行ける|negative of なる|だめ

### misc

係助詞+おろか = not to metion, forget about x, not even...
わけ(が)ない = There's no way/easy, simple
わけにはいかない = cannot (due to external circumstances); cannot afford to; must not; impossible to; no way one can (do)​
つつ＋ある = trend, process
 嫌いがある = negative trend of...
ぬ・ん + ばかり(に) =  as if to...
で/て(も)+word for ok = it's okay ... 
volitional + とする = try/attempt to ...

conditional + どう = how about...

## semantic-morphological relationships

### goodness

Words for good in order of politeness: いい＜よい＜よろしい

### languages ＆ nationalities

Kanji|country
日本|Japan
　英（えい）|England/lish

## Word classes

A fundamental distinction of words is 独立語 (lexical words) vs 付属語 (function words)
独立語 (lexical words) may further be distinguished into 
  katsuyōgo (活用語), word classes which have inflections
    dōshi (動詞), verbs,
    keiyōshi (形容詞), i-type adjectives.
    keiyōdōshi (形容動詞), na-type adjectives
  hikatsuyōgo (非活用語) or mukatsuyōgo (無活用語), word classes which do not have inflections
    meishi (名詞), nouns
    daimeishi (代名詞), pronouns
    fukushi (副詞), adverbs
    setsuzokushi (接続詞), conjunctions
    kandōshi (感動詞), interjections
    rentaishi (連体詞), adnominals
付属語 (function words) may further be distinguished into
  containing grammatical particles (助詞, joshi)  
  counter words (助数詞, josūshi),
  conjugable class consisting of auxiliary verbs (助動詞, jodōshi) (suffixes like られる)
    pure auxiliaries (also 助動詞): cannot function as independent verbs
    helper auxiliaries (補助動詞): independent verbs used as auxiliaries

Of the 付属語, 助動詞 are 活用語, the rest are not.


### 助動詞

Importantly, 助動詞 themselves can be cojugated, generally following the rules for whatever word class they are, this includes ます.
Past forms of verbs ending in ます (ました etc.) are merely conjugations of the 助動詞 ます.

#### 助動詞 proper

助動詞 are suffixed to whatever stem.

未然形|れる(u)・られる (ru, may also be shortened to れる)
未然形|ない|negative
未然形|ぬ|negative (older, precursor to modern ない, but still sometimes used)
未然形|ず|negative (older, is generally only used as adverbial today)
未然形|へん|negative (kansai)
未然形|ざる|negative (older, barely used today)
未然形|せる (u-verbs)・させる（ru-verbs, or さす (casual)|causative = make, let
連用形|たい (i-adj)/たがる (verb)|deontic modality
連用形|ます|make the verb +polite
連用形|やがる|Hatred, contempt (maybe sometimes phonologically realized as あがる?)
連用形・TRYK (single ない・いい get an additional さ)|そう|inferential evidential marker
連用形|得る (read 得る or うる)|indicates potential
終止形|そう+copula|heresay evidential marker
意志形|よう (ru-verbs)・う(anything else)|Volitional
連体形|よう|evidential marker
連体形|はず (resulting construct is noun)|should be, supposed to, expected
連体形・終止形(only of verbs)|べく|In order to
連体形・終止形(only of verbs)|べき|Should (actions that are proper or to yourself, not others)
終止形|まじ (archaic, whence まい)|negative (grammatically: negative volition; also: prohibition, impossibility)
未然形・終止形|まい|negative (grammatically: negative volition; also: prohibition, impossibility)
音便形|た|past tense
音便形|て|て形

Exceptions: 問う, 請う: 連体形/終止形 + た/て
The past of 形容詞 (かった) may seem irregular, but it is not: 連用形: かり; + 音便 ⇒ かっ; + た = かった
The past of です may seem irregular, but it is not: 連用形: でし + た ⇒ でした
The past of だ may seem irregular, but it is not: 連用形: でし + た ⇒ でした


べき/べし used to be a 助動詞 (auxiliary).
This is the odd bit. べき behaves a lot like 同じ when connecting to things after it: For nominals, べき it connects directly. When concluding sentences, it takes the copula (which can be ∅ in informal speech, but I think most people think of the copula still being there).

Most common negative conjugations: 未然形 + ない (as i-adj) + normal conjugation patterns.
Less common negative conjugations: 未然形 + ぬ (助動詞) + normal conjugation patterns.
Archaic negative conjugation: 未然形 + ず (助動詞) + normal conjugation patterns.

Thus, the negative form of べき・べし: べからず　is just the 未然形 of an I adjective から + negative ず, but since it today acts as a noun it also can be negated like one, via the copula.
なるべく "as much as possible" and なるべき "should be/become" are both derived from なる＋べく・べき

ぬ as a 助動詞 is sometimes shortened to ん, making it more casual. It still can inflect as ぬ・ない would

In the past
ます follows サ変　conjugation patterns.
ます has an irregular conjugation in the negative: ません, from ませ＋ぬ.
As an exeption, something that is polite, negative and past is ませんでした, not ませ（ん・な）かった.
To make an 形容詞 polite, a version of the polite copula です needs to be suffixed, one cannot apply the ます　助動詞 to 形容詞.

Since the ず　did not have its own conjugation, it either was replaced with ず or ぬ.
The ず negative is today only ever used to mean without, as an adverbial.
Similar in meaning for using the ず 助動詞 to mean without is the ない+で


The ず negative uses the せ 未然形 for サ変

未然形

|サ変
ず|せ・ぬ
ない、よう|し
れる・せる|さ(せ more rarely)

ましょう is used for the polite volitional form.
ましょう is derivable from: ます → 意志形=連用形 ましょ + う
Other volitional derivation examples: よい → 意志形 よかろ → よかろう
while まじ・まい is grammatically the negative volitional, it today most commmonly indicates strong denial.
まじ・まい always comes last, even after ます.
The two volitions give rise to the construction ‹volitional›が‹negative-volitional›が = whether or not

得る(える・うる) as a potential marker is less common today for anything but ある, which may not take the usual potential 助動詞

#### 補助動詞

補助動詞 either attach to the て form (the て particle/auxiliary) or the 連用形.
since 補助動詞 that attach to the て形 are the exception, it is generally safe to assume that 補助動詞 will attach to the 連用形. 
補助動詞 may be attachable to any verb, verbs with certain semantic constraints only, or only a fixed set of words, depending on the 補助動詞
Some compounds resulting from 補助動詞 are more often or only used in the nominalized 連用形 form.
おく
ある is a 補助動詞 attached -te form of transitive verbs indicating perfect/retrospective (has been completed) stative (still is the case) aspect of something that was completed in preparation for something else.
おく is a 補助動詞 attached -te form of transitive verbs indicating prospective aspect "doing in advance for something".
おく|-te form||"do something in advance"|食べておく 'eat in advance'
おく|-te form||"keep"|開けておく 'keep it open'
行く|-te form||"goes on V-ing"|歩いて行く 'keep walking'
くる|-te form||inception, "start to V"|降ってくる 'start to fall'
くる|-te form||perfection, "have V-ed" (only past-tense)|生きてきた 'have lived'
くる|-te form||conclusion, "come to V"|異なってくる 'come to differ'
みる|-te form||"try to V"|してみる 'try to do'
欲しい|-te form||deontic modality, relatively rare

te-form + しまう indicates that something was done unintentonally or finished completely.

-te form + the 補助動詞 いる indicates progressive (for verbs that describe an action) or stative aspect (for verbs that describe an event)
verbs that do not indicate that they have progressive/stative aspect via ている must therefore have a different aspect.

まくる as a verb by itself is transitive and means to to roll up (e.g. ones sleeves)
まくる||to do over and over again; to do relentlessly; to do with reckless abandon
始める|non-punctual|"V begins", "begin to V"|書き始める 'start to write'

かかる・かける|only for intrans., non-volit.|"about to V", "almost V",  -  "to start to V" |溺れかける 'about to drown'
きる||"do V completely"|食べきる 'to eat it all'
消す||"cancel by V" - "deny with V"|揉み消す 'to rub out, to extinguish'

残る|only for intrans.|"be left behind, doing V"|生き残る 'to survive', lit: to be left alive
分ける||"the proper way to V"|使い分ける 'to indicate the proper way to use'
忘れる||"to forget to V"|聞き忘れる 'to forget to ask'
兼ねる||be unable to V, find it difficult to V|
兼ねる＋neg||possibility of V (which is negative)


あう by itself is a intranstive verb meaning:
合う|to meet/unite/merge, match/suit each other, to be equitable
会う|to meet, encounter/see
逢う|to meet (of people who are close)
遭う|to encounter something bad, have an accident

The 連用形 of あう may also be spelled 相 when used as a morpheme, generally word-inital, meaning mutual, together, each other.

合う is a 補助動詞 meaning "to do V to each other/mutually/together"
　話（はな）し 　合（あ）う|discuss, talk together を
　向（む）き　合（あ）う|to face each other
　似合（にあ）う|suit, look good on
　噛（か）み　合（あ）う|bite each other, to interlock

　譲（ゆず）り　合（あ）う|to give and take, to make mutual concessions, to compromise
　述（の）べ　合（あ）う|to compare (e.g. notes); to exchange (e.g. views, opinions) を
　付（つ）き　合（あ）う|to go out with; to keep in company with
　組（く）み　合（あ）う|form a partnership, join together
　知（し）り　合（あ）う|to get to know each other; to make acquaintance

Nominalized
　待合（まちあい）|rendezvous; meeting; assignation, also: waiting room (abbrev.)
　相合（あいあい）|doing things together (archaism)|romantic implication due to pun with 愛
　相合傘（あいあいがさ）|sharing an umbrella; under one umbrella
　組合（くみあい）|(voluntary) association, union, guild

あう as a 補助動詞 is less commonly spelled 会う, in which case it may mean "to V while/in the process of meeting"
　出会（であ）う (less commonly 出合う)|meet by chance, for two roads to meet, to engage an enemy

From the causative form of 合う descends 合わせる を: to put together/combine/fuse/merge/blend/mix/join in/match with, to tune music, radio, to check with/against, to adapt oneself to.
合わさる が: to match, make a successful pairing
合わせる is frequently used as a 補助動詞, but almost always only as a 連用形 nominalization.
　打（う）ち　合（あ）わせ|advance arrangements; preparatory meeting; briefing session

っぱなし|something was completed and left that way (probably due to neglect/oversight)

出す is a 補助動詞 meaning start to V, or to V out of
　抜（ぬ）け　出（だ）す   sneak away, get away

連用形 + 　方（かた） = the way of verbing

the 未然形 of た (but really of たる) is also used as a conditional.

##### 形容詞　補助動詞

sometimes, the 形容詞 suffixes to the 連用形 are also classified as 補助動詞:
hard|づらい(--formality) / にくい(-formality) / がたい (+formality)
easy|やすい

##### also for nouns

Noun/連用形 + がち = tend tu, prone to, liable to

##### not for verbs

TRKY/na-adj/noun + がる = act like adjective

### 助詞

Particles (助詞) may be divided up into 8 kinds:

#### Case markers (格助詞, kaku-joshi)

In japanese, case is marked by particles placed after the N/NP.

まで|terminative (not actually a case marker in japanese, as it may be placed after non-NPs)
を|Accusative, Perlative
の|Genitive (Nominative w/ GNC)
が|Nominative   
よ|Vocative
に|Dative, Locative (only with states, not with actions)
と|comitative
より＆から|Ablative
より|comparative ('rather', 'more')
へ|Lative
で|Instrumental, locative (only for actions)

より can also be used as an adverb to indicate the same concept.
より can be combined with も to mean 'more than anything'

For the genitive particle, the posseed thing can be omitted if the context makes it clear.

格助詞 mark case and are attached to nouns.

#### Parallel markers (並立助詞, heiritsu-joshi)

In japanese 並立助詞 are coordinating conjunctions that link NPs.

cumulative|and|と
disjunctive with vagueness||とか or や (more formal)

#### Interjectory particles (間投助詞, kantō-joshi)

Interjectory particles are like sentence-final particles, just that they can  also occur at the end of clauses (or sometimes merely phrases).

#### Sentence final particles (終助詞, shū-joshi)


よ: adding new if information (similar but cool, masculine: ぞ, ぜ) (similar: わ)
Order is always （わ・よ・ぞ・…) + ね, not the other way around
の may act as a interrogative particle, add emphasis, or explanatory tone.
Variants of の (incl ので・のに・など): の+copula ⇒ ん+copula
⟮conjugate⟯ ⟮んだ⟯ ⟮itself⟯ and ⟮attach⟯ it to a ⟮non⟯-⟮conjugated⟯ element or atatach a conjugated element to it
the SFPs that also are/contain nominalizers (もの・の・んだ・ので・のに) do still nominalize the sentence grammatically, and thus require the attributive form in front of them.

な na: emotion. Used when one wants to express a personal feeling. May be used to state a fact in which one has emotional investment, to express one's admiration or emotional excitement, to soften an imperative, or to encourage agreement, as a mild imperative. (or variant of ね)
なあ nā: a lengthened version of the above, expresses strong emotion, either to encourage agreement, as above, or to express one's desires, e.g. 寿司を食べたいなぁ (sushi wo tabetai naa), "I want to eat sushi (so badly right now!)".


#### Adverbial particles (副助詞, fuku-joshi)

Adverbial particles add a certain meaning.
Adverbial particles seem to be treated as nouns in what follows them.
Adverbial particles seem to follow the 連用形/nouns plainly like other particles 係助詞、格助詞, acting like suffixes, other times they follow the 連体形.
|だけ (less formal)・のみ (more formal)|just
|ば(っ)かり|nothing but
|ほど
|くらい・ぐらい
|など
|きり
かり
ずつ
など・なぞ・なんぞ
か
やら
なり
連用形/nouns|がてら|on the same occasion; at the same time; coincidentally; along with
limit of scope|きり

#### Binding particles (係助詞, kakari-joshi)

Binding particles mark what the sentence is about, or increase emphasis if at the end of the sentence.
は is the stereotypical binding particle, marking the topic.
こそ
も|inclusion, something is too much
しか(variants: っきゃ)|anything but
しか requires a negative in the following clause.

even|(で)すら (more archaic)・(で)さえ (less archaic) (adding で adds emphasis)
でさえ・ですら can only attach to nouns
さえ・すら can attach to verbs stems or te-forms. 
If attaching to verbs, after さえ・すら must come a form of suru

#### Conjunctive particles (接続助詞, setsuzoku-joshi)

In japanese 接続助詞 are coordinating・subordinating conjunctions that connect clauses.

form that must be before it
未然形|
連用形|while|ながら
連用形 of verbs only|while (formal, equal weight)|つつ
終止形/end of clause|illiative|から
終止形/end of clause|illiative (non-exhaustive list)|し
終止形 of verbs/auxiliaries|illiative|なり (not the copula)
終止形/end of clause|adversative (but not always)|が or けど・けれど・けれども (more but)
終止形/end of clause|conditional (implies result is natural consequence)|と
終止形/end of clause|as soon as|や
連体形 or の|illiative|ところで or 癖に (stronger, indicates disgust)
連体形|illiative|のに
連体形|illiative|ので (more formal than から)
連体形|illiative|ものの
仮定形||ば
た-form|illiative|ところで
|ても・でも|
音便形|listing|たり (subject to similar constraints as た)

In classical japanese, ba would have been attached to the 未然形 instead of the 仮定形, hence e.g. ならば・たらば and not なれば・たれば
While not typically considered a conjunctive particle, なりの未然形 なら (alternatively analyzed as a shortened ならば) connects to the 終止形 to create the meaning of 'if given'
In modern japanese, ならば・たらば is a bit more formal than なら・たら
なければ: ない → 仮定形 = なけれ + ば

illative|
adversative|が or けど・けれど・けれども or ところが (more but) or 癖に or のに (more despite) # AN: but aren't tokoroga and kuseni acting as nouns here, not as clause-final particles (and thus are also subordinating)
けど‹けれど‹けれども in formality
けど‹が in formality

#### who the fuck knows 2

た-form+ば(っ)か(り)|action was just completed, behaves as noun
終止形・連体形 (verbs) + な|negative imperative

### 独立語

#### 非活用語

　体（たい）　言（げん）　(seems to be just nouns, pronouns, etc?)

##### 副詞

In japanese, the roles of adverbs are as in english (act as adjuncts for any number of phrases, but not NPs), they however cannot appear after the verb/copula.

もし: Make sentence more uncertain

##### 名詞

Many nouns can be verbal nouns, which means をする can be attached to them to make them a verb. often, the を is elided, producing ‹noun›する

##### 代名詞

###### 人称代名詞

Japanese is pro-drop, so less commonly used.

1st person

2nd person

Most commonly: persons name

3rd person

##### 連体詞

　連（れん）　体（たい）　詞（し） are words stuck in the 連体形, thus unconjugable

大きな
小さな
色んな
おかしな
　異（い）な|strange, odd, unusual

　心（こころ）ある|thoughtful, considerate

　無理（むり）からぬ|reasonable, natural
　素知（そし）らぬ|feigned; pretending (not to know)

　残（のこ）んの|remanining

　本（ほん）の|little, slightly, mere, only

大した
　大（だい）それた|absurd, outrageous

ひょん|unexpected, strange, unusual

とある|a certain
ある|a certain

##### 接続詞

Paraphrasing
というか|"or rather"

どころか|far from, let alone, to say nothing of

だって|contrastive, illiative|"but", "because"

##### 感動詞 ＆ discourse markers

Yael Maschler divided discourse markers into four broad categories: interpersonal, referential, structural, and cognitive.

Interpersonal markers are used to indicate the relationship between the speaker and the listener.
  Perception: "look", "believe me"
  Agreement: "exactly", or disagreement: "I'm not sure"
  Amazement: "wow"
  Surprise: え (えー)
Referential markers, usually conjunctions, are used to indicate the sequence, causality, and coordination between statements.
  Sequence: "now", "then"
  Causality: "because"
  Coordination: "and", or non-coordination: "but"
Structural markers indicate the hierarchy of conversational actions at the time in which they are spoken. These markers indicate which statements the speaker believes to be most or least important.
  Organization: "first of all"
  Introduction: "so"
  Summarization: "in the end"
Cognitive markers reveal the speaker's thought process
  Processing information: "uhh"
  Realization: "oh!"
  Rephrasing: "I mean"

#### 活用語

##### stemforms

Conjugable words can be conjugated into six basic stem forms in japanese:

Japanese distinguishes an attributive form 連体形, which acts attriubtively, and a terminal form 終止形, which goes at the end of a clause.
In modern japanese the 連体形 and 終止形 of verbs and adjectives are the same.
In the past, the 連体形 of i-adjevtives was き, while the 終止形 of i-adjectives was し.
Importantly, the 終止形 of adjectives ending しい would have also been し (not something like しし)
The terminal form is also used as the 辞書形 (i.e. the lemma)
The attributive/terminal forms of i-adjectives/verbs do not need to be formed, as that is the form one learns them in.

While japanese does not consider nouns or the copula 活用語, we may still consider them to have attributive and terminal forms.

　連（れん）　体（たい）　形（けい）.

i-adjectives|no change
na-adjectives|な
copula|な
nouns|である・な (sometimes)・の (subject to theoretical considerations)
verbs|no change

to a certain extent の can be understood as the 連体形 of nouns, since they can go where the language normally would expect 連体形. Thus, they are sometimes also called no-adjectives (since they use no where na-adj would use na.)

終止形.

i-adjectives|no change
na-adjectives|copula
copula|だ (and derivatives)
nouns|copula
verbs|no change

I-adjectives also had a 連体形 -i +かる

For the 連用形 of 形容詞, かり is used before た・て・たり and く is used before ない。

The 未然形 of u-verbs is formed by removing the final vowel, and adding an a instead.
The 未然形 of 形容詞 is formed by removing the final い, and adding  instead.
The 未然形 of u-verbs ending う is わ

There are 2 命令形 for ru-verbs, one used whie speaking and one used while writing.
the 命令形 for ru-verbs used while speaking is formed removing the る and adding ろ.
the 命令形 for ru-verbs used while writing is formed removing the る and adding よ.

The 連用形, 仮定形, 未然形, 意志形 for る-verbs all are formed by removing the る.

Etymologically, the weird stem forms of 形容詞, たる, なる, だ, ざる come from the fact that they are contractions of く・て・に・で・ず+ある・あり.

たり in 文語 indicates the stative form of verbs.
たり descend from たる.
the 助動詞 た descends from たる・たり.
た is the 終止形and 連体形, otherwises it uses the inflections of たる・たり when needed.

Modern japanese features two verb classes plus two common irregular verb classes, plus some smaller exceptions.
Japanese verb classes:
る|一段動詞|vowel-stem|end in る, preceeded by u/i
う|五段動詞|consonant-stem|don't end in る or end in る preceded by a/u/o (and by u/i in rare cases)
ru-verbs are called vowel-stem because what we would call the stem (the thing to which inflections attach) in western linguistics ends with a vowel, and conversely for consonant-stem verbs.
Other verb classes, for example 二段動詞 and 四段動詞 existed in classical japanese but are now archaic

The verb する inhabits the verb class of サ変.
The verb くる inhabits the verb class of カ変.
The linguist Kunio Nishiyama argues that the true 連用形 of an i-adjective is without its final i, which I will call TRYK (true renyoukei)
Many forms of consonant-stem verbs are actually based on just removing the vowel (just taking the consonant stem), which I will call CS


形|name|function|u-verb|i-adj 1|i-adj 2|サ変|カ変|copula (forms from なり)|たり|copula だ|copula である| copula です|classical verb あり
未然形|irrealis|base for some affixes, esp. negative ones|CS+a|く(at least in some sense)|から(?)|さ・せ・し|こ|なら|たら|だら(?)|では (であら(?))|probably none|あら
連用形|continuative|basis for most other affixes|CS+i|く|TRYK+かり|し|き|なり|たり|だり(though of course it often reduces to だっ due to 音便)|であり|でし|あり
意志形|'volitional base'|attaching the volitional auxiliary verb|CS+o|probably none|TRYK+かろ|連用形|連用形|なろ（?)|たろ|だろ|であろ|でしょ|あろ
終止形|terminal|clause-final form|no change|no change (past し)|TRYK+かり|no change|no change|なり|たり|だ|である|です|あり
連体形|attributive|attributive form|no change|no change (past き)|TRYK+かる|no change|no change|なる|たる|な|である|???|ある
仮定形|hypothetical|basis for attaching the ば particle for the conditional/subjunctive|CS+a||TRYK+から|すれ|くれ|なれ|たれ||であれ|probably none|あれ
命令形|imperative|forming commands, never takes affixes|CS+e||TRYK+かれ|しろ・せよ・せい|こい|なれ|たれ||であれ(?)|probably none|あれ

in the past, the 終止形 of verbs would have generally been -i, while the 連体形 would have been -u

##### 動詞

Verbs in japanese are often claimed to be a closed word class. While new 和語 based coinages indeed don't really happen, 片仮名-based coinages are actually not that rare.

##### 形容詞

Japanese i-adjectives mostly follow a single inflectional paradigm
いい is conjugated as よい for everything but the plain form, and so are descendanats such as 格好良い
Of the i adjectives, some end しい, mostly verbs for feeling
While it is no longer relevant, in the past those adjectives today ending しい were called しく adjectives, the others く adjectives.

##### 形容動詞

形容動詞 act similarly to nouns.
Adverbial: に
There are a number of na adjectives ending in 〜やか, particularly for subjective words.
The 〜やか in na-adjectives ending in 〜やか  used to be suffix particles - some na-adjectives can still be used without them, some cannot.
While 形容動詞 theoretically have a full set of stem forms, these are just the 形容動詞 plus the copula.

###### different attributive forms

While most 形容動詞 use な as their attributive (連体形) form and に as their adverbial form, there exist a few ones that do it differently:

Taru-adjectives have the former auxiliary verb たり instead of the copula.

naru-adjectives have the exclusive 連体形 of なる, but that's also generally the only form they can be used in.
　親愛（しんあい）なる   dear (as in "dear xyz, dear old friend, etc.")
　単（たん）なる simply

##### the copula

the copula なり can/could be spelled 也.
For the positive copula, +formality is indicated by using the formal version of the copula, である.
For the negative copula, -formality is indicated by contracting the では to じゃ, +formality is indicated by contracting it.
For the positive polarity of the -formality copula, +politeness is indicated by using versions of です instead of versions of だ
For the positive polarity of the +formality copula and any formality of the negative polarity copula, politeness is indicated by the ます　助動詞　as per usual.

The te-form of だ is technically だって. However, it's often treated as で (probably a contraction of であって)

Politness
Copula (present)
|-POL, -FORM|+POL, -FORM|-POL, +FORM|+POL, +FORM
positive polarity|だ|です|である|であります
negative polarity|じゃない|じゃありません|ではない|ではありません

Copula (past)

|-POL, -FORM|+POL, -FORM|-POL, +FORM|+POL, +FORM
positive polarity|だった|でした|であった|でありました
negative polarity|じゃなかった|じゃありませんでした|ではなかった|ではありませんでした


Adverbial of たり: と

## sound changes

### 音便

音便 rougly means euphonic changes in sounds, and groups both sound changes (diachronically) as well as alternation. 
The type of change in sound that 音便 describes is most commonly assimilation.

#### historical 

#####  kana changes

Many two-on combinations have changed their pronunciations during the evolution of japanese.
Kana spellings were updated in 1946 to reflect the changes in pronunication that had taken place in the last 700-odd years, but at one point the original kana spellings did actually reflect the pronuniciation (something not all japanese people realized)

あう|おう (pronounced ō)
あふ|おう (pronounced ō)
いふ|いう 
うふ|うう
えう|よう
えふ|よう
おふ|おう
おほ|おお
おを|おお
auxiliary verb む|ん
medial or final は|わ
medial or final ひ・へ・ほ|ゐ・ゑ・を (and then...)
any ゐ・ゑ・を|い・え・お


not reflected in spelling, いう itself has changed to mostly be pronounced ゆう

#### conjugation

Western linguistics typically analyzes forms such as the ta-form, te-form as inflections, japanese grammar instead analyzes them as auxiliaries or particles.
Analyzing ta/te/tari allows us to strip them away from the verb, revealing the fact that ru- and u verbs actually conjugate into the ta/te/tari forms the same (音便形) + aux/particle) and that consonant-stem verbs merely undergo 音便.
the 連用形 having undergone 音便 is called 音便形
b/c we can assimilate all u-verbs into the pattern stem+ta/te..., the 連用形 is actually the same thing as the ta/te stem
連用形 ending|changes to
い・ち・り|っ
び・み・に (nasal stops)|ん + following t voiced
き|い
ぎ|い + following t voiced
The 連用形 ending 音便 changes for the auxes/particles た・て... may be different in different dialects, e.g. in Kansai dialect い・ち・り changes to -u-, not to っ.

Thus the only irregular verb is 行く, which should be 行き＋て・た ⇒ いいて・た but instead becomes いって・た.

Honorific/humble verbs such as くださる、なさる、ござる、いらっしゃる、おっしゃる behave like ru-verbs, but feature an 音便 soundchange り → い

#### colloquial alternation

ては|ちゃ
では|じゃ

ちゃ・じゃ may sound girly

てしま|ちゃ or ちま
でしま|じゃ or じま

ている|てる
ていく|てく

ておく|とく

てあげる|たげる

r‹vowel›n|んn

れば・れは|りゃs

#### contractions

するべき/剃るべく may be contracted to すべき・すべく

### other

の → ん when part of sfp.
