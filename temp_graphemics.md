# graphemes ＆ graphs

## types of graphs

typically, ⟮whatevergraph⟯ and ⟮whatevergram⟯ are ⟮synonyms⟯.

### graphs with phonological realization ≈ representing basic linguistic unit

#### logograms vs phonograms

the two types of ⟮grapheme⟯ ⟮representing a basic linguistic unit⟯ are ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ and ⟮＿phonograms＿⟯
»⟮a logogram ⟯«is a ⟮graph/grapheme⟯ representing ⟮a morpheme/word⟯
»⟮a phonogram⟯« is a ⟮graph/grapheme⟯ representing ⟮one or more phonemes⟯

#### logograms

Well-known ⟮＿logographic＿⟯ writing systems are ⟮kanji/hanzi/hanja/han tu (though there are exceptions); hieroglyphs⟯
Depending on their composition, ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ may be ⟮＿non-compound＿⟯ or ⟮＿compound＿⟯.
»⟮Compound logograms⟯« are ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ ⟮consisting of multiple other logograms⟯.
»Non-compound logograms« are ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ ⟮consisting of no other logograms⟯.

##### non-compound logograms

⟮＿Non-compound logograms＿⟯ may be ⟮＿pictograms＿⟯ or ⟮＿ideograms＿⟯.
»⟮A pictogram⟯« ⟮depicts the thing⟯ it ⟮references⟯, or ⟮once did⟯.
Examples of ⟮＿pictogram＿⟯ kanji: ⟮日, 月, 山, 木, 口 etc.⟯
»⟮An ideogram⟯« ⟮attempts to visualize⟯ ⟮the abstract concept⟯ it ⟮represents⟯.
Many ⟮＿ideograms＿⟯ are ⟮derived from⟯ ⟮＿pictograms＿⟯.

##### compound logograms

some ⟮compound logograms⟯ may ⟮function similar to ideograms or pictograms⟯, but are ⟮rarely called such⟯ due to the differences.

#### phonograms

⟮＿phonograpms＿⟯ are divided into ⟮＿syllabograms＿⟯ and ⟮＿letters＿⟯.
»⟮A syllabogram⟯« is ⟮＿a graph/grapheme＿⟯ that (ideally) ⟮represents a syllable or mora⟯.
»⟮A letter⟯« is ⟮＿a graph/grapheme＿⟯ that (ideally) ⟮represents a single phoneme⟯.
A »⟮syllabary⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ that consists of ⟮＿syllabograms＿⟯.
An »⟮alphabet⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ that consists of ⟮＿letters＿⟯.

##### hybrids

I will call the ⟮characters of an abugida⟯ ⟮＿abugidogram＿⟯, though ⟮this is a term no one uses⟯.
»⟮An abugidogram⟯« is ⟮a graph/grapheme⟯ which ⟮represents a consonant⟯, and ⟮c_;vowels⟯ are ⟮added as modifications of the base character⟯.

An »⟮abjad⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ which ⟮primarily deals in consonants⟯.
A »⟮pure abjad⟯« has ⟮no way of indicating vowels whatsoever⟯.
An »⟮impure abjad⟯« has ⟮some way of indicating vowels⟯.
An ⟮＿impure abjad＿⟯ may ⟮indicate vowels⟯ with ⟮diacritics⟯ or ⟮a limited set of vowel letters⟯.

### graphs without phonological realization

»⟮blahs⟯« (my term) are ⟮a subset⟯ of ⟮graphemes⟯ ⟮not directly used to represent a basic linguistic unit such as sounds or words⟯.
⟮＿blahs＿⟯ may be ⟮＿punctuation＿⟯, ⟮＿emoji＿⟯, etc.

#### punctuation

»⟮Punctuation⟯« is ⟮a subset⟯ of ⟮＿blahs＿⟯ ⟮used to indicate some sort of interpretation help for text⟯.
⟮＿Punctuation＿⟯ may be roughly divided into ⟮＿whitespace＿⟯ and ⟮＿visible punctuation＿⟯.
A »⟮punctuation mark⟯« is ⟮a single grapheme⟯ ⟮acting as ＿punctuation＿⟯.

##### visible

###### enclosing punctuation

####### brackets

»⟮Brackets⟯« are ⟮a type of⟯ ⟮punctuation⟯ that exist in ⟮mirrored opening and closing⟯ variants and are meant to ⟮enclose something⟯.
⟮＿brackets＿⟯ is ⟮the cover term⟯ for ⟮all of ()‹›[]{}⟯.

######## names 

table:thing|name (non-us)|name (us)
⟮{}⟯|⟮curly brackets⟯|⟮braces⟯ or ⟮curly braces⟯
⟮‹›⟯|span=2;⟮angle brackets⟯ or ⟮chevrons⟯
⟮( )⟯|⟮brackets⟯, ⟮round brackets⟯|⟮parantheses⟯

⟮braces⟯ refers to ⟮{}⟯ in ⟮the US⟯, and ⟮nothing⟯ in ⟮non-US varieties⟯
⟮brackets⟯ may be used ⟮as a cover term⟯ or refer to ⟮[]⟯ in ⟮the us⟯ and ⟮()⟯ in ⟮non-us varieties⟯

Due to ⟮US cultural influence⟯, ⟮the US names⟯ for ()‹›[]{} may be ⟮recognized in other countries⟯.


###### sentence-ending punctuation

####### bang

The ⟮exlamation point⟯ may also be called a ⟮bang⟯.
Calling the ⟮exclamation point⟯ a ⟮c_;bang⟯ emerged from ⟮printing slang in the 1950s⟯. 
Off ⟮the slang term bang for !⟯ was coined the ⟮interrobang⟯ and the ⟮shebang⟯ 
the »⟮interrobang⟯« is ⟮the combination of exclamation point and question mark⟯.
⟮‽⟯ is called the ⟮interrobang⟯. 

###### intra-sentence punctuation

####### dashes ＆ hyphens

»⟮Dashes⟯« and »⟮hyphens⟯« are both ⟮＿punctuation marks＿⟯ that are ⟮horizontal lines⟯.
⟮dashes⟯ are ⟮longer⟯ than ⟮the hyphen/minus sign⟯. 
There are ⟮two common⟯ ⟮dashes⟯ (though there are more ⟮c-;uncommon⟯ ones),
The ⟮two common dashes⟯ are the ⟮en-dash⟯ and the ⟮em-dash⟯. 

###### other

####### prime

The »⟮prime⟯« is a ⟮＿punctuation mark＿⟯ looks similar to ⟮an apostrophe⟯, but ⟮angled to the right⟯. 
The »⟮double prime⟯« is ⟮two ＿primes＿⟯ »directly side by side«
The ⟮prime⟯ is often used to ⟮mark something derived from something⟯. 
Unit-wise, the ⟮prime⟯ and ⟮double prime⟯ can mark ⟮(arc)minutes⟯ and ⟮(arc)seconds⟯ respectively 


table:Symbol|Name
⟮′⟯|⟮Prime⟯
⟮″⟯|⟮Double prime⟯

##### whitespace

»⟮whitespace⟯« is ⟮＿punctuation＿⟯ that consists of ⟮space with no marks⟯.
⟮＿Whitespace＿⟯ may be ⟮＿horizontal＿⟯ or ⟮＿vertical＿⟯.

###### horizontal

»⟮horizontal whitespace⟯« is ⟮＿whitespace＿⟯ that ⟮is horizontal space (duh.)⟯
⟮＿horizontal whitespace＿⟯ as a category consists of ⟮＿space＿⟯ and ⟮＿horizontal tabs＿⟯.

####### horizontal tabs

horizontal tabs are horizontal whitespace with a width of multiple space characters.
a hard tab is the ASCII tab character.
A soft tab is multiple spaces used as 'tabs'.
In programming, the width of tabs is commonly 2 or 4 spaces.

###### vertical

A blank line is two newlines.

#### emoticons

An ⟮emoticon⟯ represents ⟮a face⟯ using  ⟮typographical characters⟯ 

⟮western⟯ ⟮emoticons⟯ have ⟮faces⟯ that are oriented ⟮left-to-right⟯ 

emoticon eyes|meaning
⟮:⟯|⟮default (more common⟯)
⟮=⟯|⟮default (less common⟯)
⟮8⟯|⟮default (super rare⟯)
⟮%⟯|⟮drunk/confused⟯
⟮X⟯|⟮c+;equivalent of ›‹ eyes, but more often used positively⟯
⟮c+;;⟯|⟮wink⟯


⟮顔文字⟯ (reading ⟮かおもじ⟯ ) have ⟮faces⟯ oriented how ⟮top-to-bottom⟯

## combinations of graphs

### digraphs 

A digraph is using two graphs to write a single phoneme.
Examples of digraphs are sh for /ʃ/ in english.
Digraphs are often combined into ligatures, and as such the term also sometimes refers to those as digraphs.

### ligatures

In writing, a ⟮ligature⟯ is when ⟮two or more characters⟯ are ⟮fused to form a single character⟯. 
Many ⟮current symbols/characters/graphemes⟯ originated as ⟮ligatures⟯, but are now ⟮ordinary characters⟯. 
⟮c+;The ampersand ＆⟯ originated as ⟮a ligature⟯ of ⟮et⟯. 
⟮圕⟯ is ⟮a rare ligature⟯ of ⟮図書館⟯

# writing systems

A writing system is a system to represent language visually.
A writing system uses an inventory of characters.
A writing system may also be known as a script.
An orthography is a set of rules for writing a language.
Digraphia is the situation of having more than one writing system for ⟮the same language⟯

Orthographic depth is the degree of deviation from the ideal correspondence between one character and one referred item (morpheme, syllable, phoneme...)
A phonemic orthography is the special case of an alphabet specifically having no or little orthographic depth.
ortographically deep|English
ortographically shallow|spanish, japanese

## properties

### letter case

⟮Letter case⟯ is ⟮the distinction between⟯ ⟮uppercase/capital/majuscle and lowercase/minuscle letters⟯. 
⟮uppercase letter⟯ = ⟮captial letter⟯ = ⟮majuscle⟯ 
⟮lowercase letter⟯ = ⟮minuscle⟯  
⟮How⟯ ⟮letter case⟯ ⟮is applied to⟯ ⟮a certain unit (sentences, words, etc⟯) is known as ⟮capitalization⟯. 
⟮Capitalization⟯ is a feature of ⟮(a) orthgraphy⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮bicameral⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮don't have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮unicameral⟯. 
In ⟮bicameral⟯ writing systems, ⟮the uppercase letters⟯ are ⟮generally larger than⟯ ⟮the lowercase letters⟯.

#### title case

⟮Title case⟯ AKA ⟮headline case⟯ is a style of ⟮capitalization⟯ used for ⟮rendering the titles of published works or works of art⟯ in ⟮English⟯. 
In ⟮title case⟯, ⟮major words (subject to definition⟯) are ⟮capitalized⟯, as are ⟮the first and last word of the title⟯. 
⟮Exact rules of capitalization⟯ in ⟮title case⟯ ⟮vary⟯. 
Most commonly, ⟮most words⟯ are considered ⟮major words⟯ and thus ⟮capitalized⟯, while ⟮s13:14;⟮articles⟯, ⟮conjunctions⟯ and ⟮preposititons⟯ are considered ⟮not major words⟯ and thus ⟮not capitalized⟯ (though ⟮s15:18;⟮some, e.g. the AP Style guide,⟯ recommend capitalizing them if ⟮they are four characters or more) ⟯⟯⟯ 

# written media

## manuscripts

A manuscript is a non-printed written work.
Sometimes, the term manuscript is a written work on any media, as long as it is not in its final form.
Before the advent of printing, all books were manuscripts.

### palimpsest

flex-container:✫sm_paste-08cee722aa3a0d331ac53f3027ef7cf35ad457e2.jpg✫
A palimpsest is a manuscript page on which multiple different texts have been written.
For palmipsests, generally the previous layer was erased before the new layer was written, though with varying degrees of success.
Palimpsest as a term is sometimes exteded to refer to any palimpsest-like superimposition.
