»⟮Typography⟯« is the field concerned with ⟮the properties/use of⟯ ⟮type and text (in a wide sense)⟯
⟮＿Typography＿⟯ is divided into ⟮＿microtypography＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿macrotypography＿⟯.

»⟮Microtypography⟯« is typography on the level of ⟮letters/words⟯
Examples of ⟮＿microtypographic＿⟯ properties/concerns are ⟮letter spacing, word spacing, ligatures, features of letters⟯
»⟮Macrotypography⟯« is typography on the level of ⟮the collumn/grid/page⟯
Examples of ⟮＿macrotypographic＿⟯ properties/concerns are ⟮Typographic hierarchy, typographic grid, page layout⟯

### fonts and font families

A synonym of ⟮typeface⟯ is ⟮font family⟯. 
A »⟮typeface⟯« is ⟮a set of glyphs⟯ ⟮with a certain unified look⟯. 
⟮a »font«⟯ is ⟮a ＿typeface＿⟯ ⟮with certain characteristcs⟯. 
Ergo, there are ⟮many ＿fonts＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿typeface＿.⟯ 
Properties that are ⟮varied⟯ to ⟮produce different ＿fonts＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿typeface＿⟯ are most commonly ⟮＿weight＿⟯, ⟮size⟯, and ⟮slope⟯, though ⟮other things can also be varied⟯. 

### fonts

#### weight

The »⟮weight⟯« of ⟮a particular ＿font＿⟯ is ⟮the thickness of the characters⟯ ⟮relative to their height⟯. 
⟮＿font weights⟯＿ are often given on ⟮a scale⟯ ⟮from 100 through 900⟯
The ⟮TrueType⟯ font format introduced the ⟮100-900 scale⟯ for font weights
The ⟮100-900 scale⟯ for font weights is also used in ⟮CSS⟯ and ⟮OpenType⟯, 
in the 100 to 900 scale, ⟮400⟯ is ⟮regular⟯ 
in the 100 to 900 scale, ⟮700⟯ is ⟮bold⟯ 
Originally, any font-weight ⟮in the 100 - 900 scale⟯ that was ⟮not a multiple of 100⟯ was ⟮meaningless⟯
in ⟮variable-weight fonts⟯, a ⟮font weight⟯ may be ⟮any number between 1 and 1000⟯. 

#### keming & letter-spacing

flex-container:✫sm_paste-f07c2c687494aa635cc4e1bac28fd932457a1b35.jpg✫✫sm_220px-Metal_type_kerning.svg.png✫


⟮Letter-spacing⟯ = ⟮tracking⟯
»⟮Letter-spacing/tracking⟯« and »⟮c_;kerning⟯« are both ⟮the adjustment of⟯ ⟮the horizontal distance⟯ ⟮between glyphs⟯
»⟮Letter-spacing/tracking⟯« is the ⟮adjustment of the (horizontal) distance between glyphs⟯ ⟮for all glyphs equally⟯. 
»⟮Kerning⟯« is the ⟮adjustment of the (horizontal) distance between glyphs⟯ ⟮between two specific glyphs⟯. 
⟮＿Kerning＿⟯ is generally to ⟮achieve a similar amount of whitespace⟯ between glyphs. 
Original, the »⟮kern⟯« of ⟮a glyph or its sort⟯ was ⟮the part that overhangs its sort⟯. 
⟮＿kerning＿⟯ generally involves ⟮intruding into⟯ ⟮the box of another glyph's sort⟯. 
⟮＿Kerning＿⟯ is only relevant for ⟮proportional/variable-width⟯ fonts. 

### font families

#### type, sort

flex-container:⟮h∞;✫sm_220px-Metal_movable_type.jpg✫⟯


⟮»A type «(countable)⟯ is ⟮a block⟯ ⟮with a glyph on it⟯ used ⟮for printing⟯.
⟮»Type« (uncountable)⟯ is ⟮types collectively⟯.
⟮A type⟯ may thus also be called ⟮a piece/block of type⟯.
In most printing processes, ⟮type⟯ was made of ⟮metal⟯.
»⟮A sort⟯« is ⟮a type⟯ for ⟮a single character with certain characteristics (weight, size, etc.)⟯.
⟮type⟯ and ⟮sort⟯ only apply to ⟮movable type⟯.

#### font size

The »⟮font size⟯« specifies the ⟮＿body height＿⟯. 
Thus, if using ⟮movable type⟯, ⟮the ＿font size＿⟯ specifes ⟮the physical height of the ＿sort＿.⟯ 
Thus, if using ⟮digital type⟯, ⟮＿font size＿⟯ is ⟮the height that the ＿em square＿ is scaled to⟯. 
Stated differently, in ⟮digital type⟯, ⟮setting a specific ＿font size＿⟯ ⟮scales up the ＿em square＿⟯. 
⟮The ＿font size＿⟯ is called ⟮「point size」⟯ if ⟮specified in point⟯, or ⟮sometimes also if not⟯. 
»⟮em⟯« is a unit ⟮relative to⟯ ⟮the current ＿font size＿⟯.
Ergo, the ⟮＿font size＿⟯ is equal to ⟮1em (by definition)⟯.
Following the general definition of the font size, in css ⟮the em⟯ is ⟮equivalent to⟯ ⟮the current font-size.⟯ 

#### units

##### ems and ens

flex-container:✫220px-M_versus_em.svg.png✫


⟮the sort⟯ of ⟮uppercase Ms⟯ used to be ⟮as wide as tall (i.e. square)⟯,
⟮em⟯ is sometimes also defined as ⟮the width⟯ of an ⟮uppercase (or more rarely lowercase)⟯ ⟮M⟯.
Defining an em as ⟮the width of an uppercase m⟯ is ⟮equivalent to⟯ ⟮the usual definition⟯ since ⟮the sort of uppercase Ms used to be square.⟯
!The »⟮en⟯« is either
- !⟮half the width⟯ of ⟮an em⟯. 
- !⟮the width⟯ of ⟮an uppercase or lowercase⟯ ⟮n⟯. 
The »⟮en/em space/dash⟯« are ⟮a space and dash⟯ that are defined as ⟮one en/em⟯ ⟮wide⟯.
The ⟮en/em space⟯ and ⟮c_;en/em dash⟯ are ⟮one en/em⟯ ⟮wide⟯. 
Due to ⟮the confusion about definitions of en/ems⟯, sometimes ⟮variant definitions⟯ for ⟮en/em dashes/spaces⟯ are used. 

##### point

In typography, the »⟮point⟯« is ⟮the smallest⟯ ⟮unit of measure⟯. 
⟮the exact size⟯ of ⟮the ＿point＿⟯ ⟮has varied⟯.
⟮＿point＿⟯ is often abbreviated ⟮pt⟯ or ⟮c_;just p⟯. 
»⟮A pica⟯« is ⟮12 point (whatever point you're using)⟯.

###### DTP point

⟮DTP point⟯ = ⟮DeskTop Publishing point⟯.
the ⟮＿DTP point＿⟯ ⟮came into existence⟯ ⟮with digital printing⟯.
The ⟮＿DTP point＿⟯ has become a sort of ⟮standard ＿point＿⟯.
the »⟮DTP point⟯« is defined as ⟮1/72 inch⟯.
If using ⟮the ＿DTP point＿⟯, ⟮＿a pica＿⟯ is ⟮1/6 inch⟯.

###### css

⟮CSS⟯ uses ⟮the DTP⟯ ⟮＿point＿⟯.
In ⟮CSS⟯, ⟮`pt`⟯ is the unit name for ⟮＿point＿⟯.
In ⟮CSS⟯, ⟮`pc`⟯ is the unit name for ⟮＿pica＿⟯.

###### tex

⟮TeX's⟯ ⟮bp⟯ is ⟮equivalent to the DTP point⟯.
⟮TeX's⟯ ⟮pt⟯ is ⟮very slightly smaller than the DTP point⟯. 

#### type anatomy

flex-container:⟮h∞;✫1280px-Typography_Line_Terms.svg.png✫✫decender.png✫✫1280px-Thank_You_(13824254433).jpg✫⟯

##### body

»⟮the body height⟯« is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the ＿ascender＿ and ＿descender line＿⟯. 
The ⟮＿body height＿⟯ when talking about ⟮movable type⟯ is ⟮the height of the sort⟯. 

##### baseline, mean line

The »⟮baseline⟯« is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮on which most letters sit⟯.
The »⟮mean line⟯« is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮up to which most lowercase letters extend⟯.

##### x-height

⟮x-height⟯ = ⟮corpus size⟯
The »⟮x-height⟯« is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮＿baseline＿ and ＿mean line＿⟯.
⟮the height of the x-height⟯ typically ⟮corresponds to the height of the x⟯, ⟮hence the name⟯. 

##### overshoot

»⟮Overshoot⟯« is when letters ⟮extend a little⟯ ⟮above or below⟯ ⟮the lines meant to constrain them⟯.
If downwards, ⟮＿overshoot＿⟯ is extending beyond the ⟮＿baseline＿⟯.
If upwards, ⟮＿overshoot＿⟯ is extending beyond the ⟮＿x-height＿ or ＿cap height＿⟯.
⟮＿Overshoot＿⟯ is used due to ⟮quirks with our perception⟯, where otherwise ⟮the non-overshot letters would look slightly too small⟯.
⟮＿Overshoot＿⟯ is generally used for ⟮round⟯ or ⟮c_;pointy⟯ leters.

##### ascenders, descenders, line spacing

A »⟮descender⟯« is ⟮the portion of a letter⟯ which ⟮extends below the ＿baseline＿⟯. 
Letters such as ⟮lowercase y, g, and j⟯ typically have ⟮＿descenders＿⟯. 
»⟮the descender depth⟯« is the ⟮distance⟯ ⟮the ＿descender＿ reaches below the ＿baseline＿⟯ 
A »⟮ascender⟯« is ⟮the portion of a letter⟯ which ⟮extends above the ＿baseline＿⟯. 
Letters such as ⟮lowercase f, h and uppercase letters (if we want to count them⟯) typically have ⟮＿ascenders＿⟯. 
The »⟮ascender height⟯« is the ⟮distance⟯ that ⟮＿ascenders＿ reach above the ＿baseline＿⟯. 
The ⟮＿ascender height＿⟯ is generally ⟮higher than⟯ ⟮the ＿cap-height＿⟯ 
⟮ascender line⟯ = ⟮topline⟯
The »⟮ascender/descender line⟯« is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮defined by⟯ ⟮the ＿ascender height/descender depth＿⟯ 
⟮Line spacing⟯ = ⟮leading⟯
»⟮Line spacing⟯« is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the ＿descender line＿⟯ and ⟮the next ＿ascender line＿⟯ 

##### super/subscript

⟮＿Subscript＿ and ＿superscipt＿⟯ text is usually ⟮smaller than⟯ regular text. 
»⟮Superscript⟯« text is text whose ⟮＿baseline＿⟯ ⟮sits somewhat above⟯ ⟮c-;the general ＿baseline＿⟯. 
»⟮Subscript⟯« text may ⟮sit at the general ＿baseline＿⟯ and ⟮just be smaller⟯ or ⟮have a ＿baseline＿⟯ ⟮somewhat below⟯ ⟮c-;the general ＿baseline＿⟯.


##### em square ＆ relative sizing

flex-container:✫220px-Metal_type.svg.png✫

The »⟮em square⟯« is ⟮an imaginary square⟯ ⟮around which parts of letters are sized⟯.
The ⟮＿em square＿⟯ is used in ⟮digital typography⟯.
The ⟮＿em square＿⟯ is ⟮1em⟯ ⟮wide and high⟯.
Using ⟮＿the em sqare＿⟯ allows us to ⟮give the size⟯ of ⟮any other part of the font (e.g. ascender height, x-height, cap height, etc. etc.)⟯ ⟮in em⟯.
The size relationship ⟮between parts of letters⟯ ofc. depends on ⟮the typeface⟯.

###### average relative sizing

table:type property|size
⟮cap height⟯|⟮0.7em⟯
⟮x-height⟯|⟮0.5em⟯

#### font properties

##### serifs

Serifs are these little bits sticking out of some letters.
One major axis along which font families are distinguished is if they have serifs or not.

##### monospace

A monospaced font where all characters occupy the same horizontal space.
A font that is not monospaced is proportional-width.

#### installation

⟮installing custom font families⟯ is possible on ⟮most desktop os⟯, but not on ⟮android⟯ (and ofc not on ⟮ios⟯)

## macrotypography

### columns

A »⟮column⟯« is ⟮(a) vertical block(s) of content⟯ ⟮positioned on a page⟯.
⟮＿Columnns＿⟯ and ⟮c_;rows⟯ are ⟮separated by⟯ ⟮＿gutters＿⟯.
»⟮Gutters⟯« are ⟮whitespace⟯ ⟮between⟯ ⟮two rows or columns⟯.

### page

#### page layout

##### spacing

###### margins

flex-container:✫220px-Margins.svg.png✫


the ⟮margin⟯ is ⟮the area between⟯ ⟮the main content of a page⟯ and ⟮its edges⟯.

###### alignment & indentation

flex-container:✫https://barbarakristaponis.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dividequote1-e1447790290375.png?w=400✫


»⟮x-aligned⟯« text is where ⟮a line⟯ w⟮ill always start⟯ at ⟮the x side (or at a certain offset)⟯
»⟮A rag⟯« is an ⟮uneven⟯ ⟮margin⟯.
⟮＿x-aligned＿⟯ text will have ⟮＿rags＿⟯ on ＿the opposite side＿.
Text being »⟮flush (with) x⟯« is when the text ⟮touches the x side⟯.
»⟮Indentation⟯« is ⟮empty space⟯ at ⟮the beginning of the line⟯ so ⟮it is no longer flush⟯
»⟮A hanging indent⟯« is one way in which a paragraph might be ⟮x-aligned⟯ but not ⟮completely flush x⟯.
Using a ⟮＿hanging indent＿⟯, ⟮the first line⟯ is ⟮flush x⟯ and ⟮c-;subsequented lines⟯ are ⟮indented⟯.
Using a ⟮＿hanging indent＿⟯ is also called »⟮flush and hang style⟯«.

»⟮Justified⟯« text is ⟮both⟯ ⟮flush left⟯ ⟮c-;and⟯ ⟮right⟯.
⟮＿Justified＿⟯ text manages to be ⟮both flush left and right⟯ by ⟮squishing and stretching letter-spacing⟯.

###### rivers

»⟮rivers⟯« are ⟮gaps of white space⟯ ⟮running across multiple lines⟯.
⟮rivers⟯ may happen due to e.g. ⟮＿justification＿⟯.

#### things that may be placed on pages

##### notes

»⟮A note proper⟯« is ⟮a string⟯ placed ⟮in a different place⟯ ⟮than the place it semantically belongs to⟯.
⟮＿notes proper＿⟯ most commonly include ⟮citation information⟯ or ⟮comments of some kind⟯
⟮＿Notes proper＿⟯ are generally ⟮gathered⟯ ⟮in a section just for them⟯.
I will call ⟮the section for notes proper⟯ a »⟮note section⟯«.
A »⟮note indicator⟯« (my term) is ⟮a string⟯ or ⟮c_;symbol⟯.
The string/symbol making up ⟮＿a note indicator＿⟯ is most commonly a ⟮supercripted numeral⟯ with or without ⟮square brackets⟯
^e.g. ⎴n⎴ or ⎴[n]⎴.
A »⟮in-text note indicator⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a note indicator＿⟯ placed ⟮＿in-text＿⟯.
A »⟮note-proper-attached note indicator⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a note indicator＿⟯ ⟮attached to a note proper⟯.
A »⟮note indicator pair⟯« (my term) consists of ⟮＿a in-text note indicator＿⟯ and ⟮＿a note-proper-attached-note indicator＿⟯ ⟮using the same string/symbol⟯.
»⟮A note⟯« consists of ⟮＿the note proper＿⟯ plus ⟮＿a note indicator pair＿⟯.
The ⟮＿in-text note indicator＿⟯ goes ⟮after⟯ ⟮any punctuation mark⟯.
The ⟮＿note section＿⟯ may be placed ⟮at the end of the page⟯ or ⟮the end of the chapter/paper/whatever⟯.
If ⟮the note seciton is placed at the end of the page⟯, ⟮＿the notes＿⟯ are known as »⟮footnotes⟯«.
If ⟮the note seciton is placed at the end of the chapter/paper/whatever⟯, ⟮＿the notes＿⟯ are known as »⟮endnotes⟯«.

### multiple pages

#### division

##### pagination

⟮pagination⟯ = ⟮paging⟯
»⟮pagination⟯« is ⟮dividing⟯ ⟮a given document⟯ ⟮c_-;into⟯ ⟮discrete pages⟯.

#### relationships between pages

##### orphans and widows

flex-container:✫sm_BdflVyb4vu7o0q5hCeBkmu09nMn21opE.jpg✫


»⟮Widows/orphans⟯« refer to ⟮stranded things⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of⟯ ⟮other things⟯. 

!»⟮Widows/orphans⟯« may either refer to
- !stranded ⟮words⟯ at the beginning/end of ⟮c_;paragraphs⟯
- !stranded ⟮lines⟯ at the beginning/end of ⟮c_;pages⟯. 

There is ⟮no agreement⟯ on ⟮which of widows or orphans⟯ refers to the things occurring at ⟮the beginnings or ends⟯ of other things.

#### alternating pages

##### verso and recto

»⟮verso and recto⟯« refer to ⟮the sides⟯ of ⟮a page⟯
⟮recto⟯ is ⟮the front⟯ of the page
⟮verso⟯ is ⟮the back⟯ of the page. 
⟮Recto⟯ is ⟮the front of the page⟯ since ⟮you will see it first if reading the book normally⟯

# graphemes ＆ graphs

## types of graphs

### graphs with phonological realization

logogram/graph ↔ phonogram/graph
logogram|character represents morpheme/word|Kanji/hanzi/hanja/han tu (though there are exceptions); hieroglyphs 
phonogram|character represents one or more phonemes|Latin letters, hangul, kana

Different types of logograms: pictograms, ideograms
Different types of phonographic writing systems: alphabets, syllabaries, abjads, abugidas
Abjads and abugidas may be considered syllabaries (as there is generally a character per syllable) or not (as the characters do not actually repesent languages)

A pictogram depicts the thing it represents by resemblance (or once did).
Examples of pictogram kanji: 日, 月, 山, 木, 口 etc.
An ideogram represents to a more abstract concept
Many ideograms are derived from pictograms.

A syllabogram is a character that (ideally) represents a syllable or mora.
A letter is a character that (ideally) represents a single phoneme.


writing system|consist of characters called|examples
syllabary|syllabogram|hiragana, katakana
alphabet|letters|latin alphabet, greek alphabet

### graphs without phonological realization

#### typographical symbols

##### punctuation

Punctuation is a subset of typographical symbols as well as spacing used to indicate something (such as syntax, pragmatics etc.).
Most logographic systemss as well as japanese do not use whitespace for punctuation.
In japanese, using a question mark is optional when ending a sentence with the interrogative particle か.

###### dashes

There are two common ⟮dashes⟯ (though there are more uncommon ones), the ⟮en-dash⟯ and the ⟮em-dash⟯. 
⟮dashes⟯ are ⟮longer⟯ than ⟮the hyphen/minus sign⟯. 

######## english

You use ⟮en dashes⟯ to ⟮list things in a range⟯, and sometimes ⟮for some more unwieldy prefixes (Elvis Presley–style, pre–World War II⟯) 
You use ⟮hyphens⟯ to ⟮join⟯/⟮separate⟯ words 
You use ⟮em dashes⟯ to ⟮separate parts of sentences (The new house is said to be beautiful — though if beautiful is the right word, I am not so sure⟯), or ⟮when someone is being interrupted (“Wait!

### digraphs 

A digraph is using two graphs to write a single phoneme.
Examples of digraphs are sh for /ʃ/ in english.
Digraphs are often combined into ligatures, and as such the term also sometimes refers to those as digraphs.

# writing systems

A writing system is a system to represent language visually.
A writing system uses an inventory of characters.
A writing system may also be known as a script.
An orthography is a set of rules for writing a language.
Digraphia is the situation of having more than one writing system for ⟮the same language⟯

Orthographic depth is the degree of deviation from the ideal correspondence between one character and one referred item (morpheme, syllable, phoneme...)
A phonemic orthography is the special case of an alphabet specifically having no or little orthographic depth.
ortographically deep|English
ortographically shallow|spanish, japanese

## properties

### letter case

⟮Letter case⟯ is ⟮the distinction between⟯ ⟮uppercase/capital/majuscle and lowercase/minuscle letters⟯. 
⟮uppercase letter⟯ = ⟮captial letter⟯ = ⟮majuscle⟯ 
⟮lowercase letter⟯ = ⟮minuscle⟯  
⟮How⟯ ⟮letter case⟯ ⟮is applied to⟯ ⟮a certain unit (sentences, words, etc⟯) is known as ⟮capitalization⟯. 
⟮Capitalization⟯ is a feature of ⟮(a) orthgraphy⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮bicameral⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮don't have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮unicameral⟯. 
In ⟮bicameral⟯ writing systems, ⟮the uppercase letters⟯ are ⟮generally larger than⟯ ⟮the lowercase letters⟯.

⟮Exact rules of capitalization⟯ in ⟮title case⟯ ⟮vary⟯. 
Most commonly, ⟮most words⟯ are considered ⟮major words⟯ and thus ⟮capitalized⟯, while ⟮s13:14;⟮articles⟯, ⟮conjunctions⟯ and ⟮preposititons⟯ are considered ⟮not major words⟯ and thus ⟮not capitalized⟯ (though ⟮s15:18;⟮some, e.g. the AP Style guide,⟯ recommend capitalizing them if ⟮they are four characters or more) ⟯⟯⟯ 

# written media

## manuscripts

A manuscript is a non-printed written work.
Sometimes, the term manuscript is a written work on any media, as long as it is not in its final form.
Before the advent of printing, all books were manuscripts.

### palimpsest

flex-container:✫sm_paste-08cee722aa3a0d331ac53f3027ef7cf35ad457e2.jpg✫
A palimpsest is a manuscript page on which multiple different texts have been written.
For palmipsests, generally the previous layer was erased before the new layer was written, though with varying degrees of success.
Palimpsest as a term is sometimes exteded to refer to any palimpsest-like superimposition.
