### fonts and font families

A synonym of ⟮typeface⟯ is ⟮font family⟯. 
A »⟮typeface⟯« is ⟮a set of glyphs⟯ ⟮with a certain unified look⟯. 
⟮a »font«⟯ is ⟮a ＿typeface＿⟯ ⟮with certain characteristcs⟯. 
Ergo, there are ⟮many ＿fonts＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿typeface＿.⟯ 
Properties that are ⟮varied⟯ to ⟮produce different ＿fonts＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿typeface＿⟯ are most commonly ⟮＿weight＿⟯, ⟮size⟯, and ⟮slope⟯, though ⟮other things can also be varied⟯. 

### fonts

#### weight

The »⟮weight⟯« of ⟮a particular ＿font＿⟯ is ⟮the thickness of the characters⟯ ⟮relative to their height⟯. 
⟮＿font weights⟯＿ are often given on ⟮a scale⟯ ⟮from 100 through 900⟯
The ⟮TrueType⟯ font format introduced the ⟮100-900 scale⟯ for font weights
The ⟮100-900 scale⟯ for font weights is also used in ⟮CSS⟯ and ⟮OpenType⟯, 
in the 100 to 900 scale, ⟮400⟯ is ⟮regular⟯ 
in the 100 to 900 scale, ⟮700⟯ is ⟮bold⟯ 
Originally, any font-weight ⟮in the 100 - 900 scale⟯ that was ⟮not a multiple of 100⟯ was ⟮meaningless⟯
in ⟮variable-weight fonts⟯, a ⟮font weight⟯ may be ⟮any number between 1 and 1000⟯. 

#### keming & letter-spacing

⟮Letter-spacing⟯ = ⟮tracking⟯
»⟮Letter-spacing/tracking⟯« and »⟮c_;kerning⟯« are both ⟮the adjustment of⟯ ⟮the horizontal distance⟯ ⟮between glyphs⟯
»⟮Letter-spacing/tracking⟯« is the ⟮adjustment of the (horizontal) distance between glyphs⟯ ⟮for all glyphs equally⟯. 
»⟮Kerning⟯« is the ⟮adjustment of the (horizontal) distance between glyphs⟯ ⟮between two specific glyphs⟯. 
⟮＿Kerning＿⟯ is generally to ⟮achieve a similar amount of whitespace⟯ between glyphs. 
Original, the »⟮kern⟯« of ⟮a glyph or its sort⟯ was ⟮the part that overhangs its sort⟯. 
⟮＿kerning＿⟯ generally involves ⟮intruding into⟯ ⟮the box of another glyph's sort⟯. 
⟮＿Kerning＿⟯ is only relevant for ⟮proportional/variable-width⟯ fonts. 

### font families

#### type, sort

flex-container:⟮h∞;✫sm_220px-Metal_movable_type.jpg✫⟯


⟮»A type «(countable)⟯ is ⟮a block⟯ ⟮with a glyph on it⟯ used ⟮for printing⟯.
⟮»Type« (uncountable)⟯ is ⟮types collectively⟯.
⟮A type⟯ may thus also be called ⟮a piece/block of type⟯.
In most printing processes, ⟮type⟯ was made of ⟮metal⟯.
»⟮A sort⟯« is ⟮a type⟯ for ⟮a single character with certain characteristics (weight, size, etc.)⟯.

#### font size

The ⟮font/point size⟯ specifies the ⟮body height⟯. 
Thus, if using ⟮movable type⟯, ⟮the font/point size⟯ specifes ⟮the physical height of the sort.⟯ 
Thus, if using ⟮digital type⟯, ⟮font/point size⟯ is ⟮the height that the em square is scaled to⟯. 
Stated differently, in ⟮digital type⟯, ⟮setting a specific font size⟯ ⟮scales up the em square⟯. 
⟮The font size⟯ is called ⟮point size⟯ if ⟮specified in point⟯, or ⟮sometimes also if not⟯. 
The ⟮font/point size⟯ is equal to ⟮1em⟯ (by ⟮definition⟯), i.e. ⟮em is a measure relative to the body height⟯. 
Following the general definition of the font size, in css ⟮the em⟯ i⟮s equivalent to⟯ ⟮the current font-size.⟯ 

#### ems and ens

flex-container:✫220px-M_versus_em.svg.png✫


Because ⟮the sort⟯ of ⟮uppercase Ms⟯ used to be ⟮as wide as tall (i.e. square⟯), ⟮em⟯ is sometimes also defined as ⟮the width of an uppercase⟯ (or more rarely ⟮lowercase⟯) ⟮M⟯.
The ⟮en⟯ may be defined as ⟮half the width⟯ of ⟮an em⟯. 
The ⟮en⟯ has also sometimes been defined as ⟮the width⟯ of ⟮an uppercase⟯ or ⟮lowercase⟯ ⟮n⟯. 
The ⟮en space⟯ and ⟮en dash⟯ are ⟮one en⟯ ⟮wide⟯. 
The ⟮em space⟯ and ⟮em dash⟯ are ⟮one em⟯ ⟮wide⟯. 
Due to ⟮the confusion about definitions of en/ems⟯, sometimes ⟮variant definitions⟯ for ⟮en/em dashes/spaces⟯ are used. 

#### point

In typography, the ⟮point⟯ is ⟮the smallest⟯ ⟮unit of measure⟯. 
With the advent of digital printing, ⟮a standard point (for printing⟯) has emerged, known as the ⟮DTP⟯ ⟮(c:5;DeskTop Publishing point⟯) 
the ⟮DTP⟯ ⟮(c:6;DeskTop Publishing point⟯) is defined as ⟮1/72⟯ of ⟮an inch⟯ 
the ⟮point⟯ is equivalent to ⟮1/12⟯ of ⟮a pica⟯. 
The ⟮CSS⟯ ⟮pt⟯ is ⟮the same as the DTP point⟯, as is ⟮TeX's⟯ ⟮bp⟯. 
⟮TeX's⟯ ⟮pt⟯ is ⟮very slightly smaller than⟯ the ⟮DTP point⟯. 
⟮point⟯ is often abbreviated ⟮pt⟯ or ⟮just p⟯.

The ⟮body height⟯ when talking about ⟮movable type⟯ is ⟮the height of the sort⟯. 
The ⟮body height⟯ when talking about ⟮digital typography⟯ is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the top of the tallest letterform⟯ and ⟮the bottom of the lowest one⟯. 
Equivalently, we may also define ⟮the body height⟯ as ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the ascender⟯ and ⟮descender⟯ ⟮line⟯. 

The ⟮body height⟯ when talking about ⟮movable type⟯ is ⟮the height of the sort⟯. 
The ⟮body height⟯ when talking about ⟮digital typography⟯ is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the top of the tallest letterform⟯ and ⟮the bottom of the lowest one⟯. 
Equivalently, we may also define ⟮the body height⟯ as ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the ascender⟯ and ⟮descender⟯ ⟮line⟯. 

the height of the ⟮x-height⟯ typically corresponds to ⟮the height of the x⟯, hence ⟮the name⟯. 
some letters are ⟮a little higher⟯ than ⟮the x-height⟯ (if ⟮lowercase⟯) or ⟮the cap height⟯ (if ⟮uppercase⟯) and thus extend ⟮slightly below⟯ ⟮the baseline⟯ or ⟮above⟯ ⟮the x-height⟯/⟮cap height⟯, this is called ⟮overshoot⟯. 
⟮Overshoot⟯ is generally used for ⟮round letters⟯ to make them ⟮appear the same size as square letters⟯. (Due to ⟮quirks with our perception⟯ ) 

A ⟮descender⟯ is ⟮the portion of a letter⟯ which ⟮extends below the baseline⟯. 
Letters such as ⟮lowercase y, g, and j⟯ typically have ⟮descenders⟯. 
⟮the descender depth⟯ is the ⟮distance⟯ ⟮the descender reaches below the baseline⟯ 
A ⟮ascender⟯ is ⟮the portion of a letter⟯ which ⟮extends above the baseline⟯. 
Letters such as ⟮lowercase f, h and uppercase letters (if we want to count them⟯) typically have ⟮ascenders⟯. 
The ⟮ascender height⟯ is the ⟮distance⟯ that ⟮ascenders reach above the baseline⟯. 
The ⟮ascender height⟯ is generally ⟮higher than⟯ ⟮the cap-height⟯ 
The ⟮ascender line⟯ (or ⟮c+;s60;topline⟯)/⟮descender line⟯ is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮defined by⟯ ⟮the ascender height⟯/⟮descender depth⟯ 
⟮Line spacing⟯ / ⟮c+;s65;leading⟯ is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the descender line⟯ and ⟮the next ascender line⟯ 

flex-container:✫220px-Metal_type.svg.png✫


In ⟮digital type⟯, letters are ⟮designed around⟯ ⟮an imaginary square⟯ called ⟮the em square⟯. 
⟮The relationship⟯ of ⟮parts of letters⟯ to ⟮the font size⟯ is determined by ⟮the designer of the font⟯. However, as a very rough guideline, an ⟮"average" font⟯ might have ⟮a cap height⟯ of ⟮0.7 em⟯, and an ⟮x-height⟯ of ⟮0.5 em⟯. 

##### serifs

Serifs are these little bits sticking out of some letters.
One major axis along which font families are distinguished is if they have serifs or not.

##### monospace

A monospaced font where all characters occupy the same horizontal space.
A font that is not monospaced is proportional-width.

#### installation

⟮installing custom font families⟯ is possible on ⟮most desktop os⟯, but not on ⟮android⟯ (and ofc not on ⟮ios⟯)

## macrotypography

### lines

⟮Subscript⟯ and ⟮superscipt⟯ text is usually ⟮smaller than⟯ regular text. 
⟮Superscript⟯ text is text that ⟮sits somewhat above the baseline⟯. 
⟮Subscript⟯ text is text that ⟮appears at or below the baseline⟯. 
If a ⟮subscript⟯ appears ⟮at the baseline (and not below it⟯), it must be ⟮smaller⟯, or it will not seem to be ⟮subscript⟯. 

### columns

In typography, a column is one or more vertical blocks of content positioned on a page, separated by gutters.
Gutters are whitespace between two rows or columns.

### page

#### division

##### pagination

pagination/paging is dividing a given document into discrete pages.

#### page layout

##### margins and indentation

flex-container:✫220px-Margins.svg.png✫


In typography, the ⟮margin⟯ is ⟮the area between⟯ ⟮the main content of a page⟯ and ⟮its edges⟯. 
In typography, if the spacing ⟮is squished or stretched⟯ such that the ⟮text is flush with⟯ ⟮both the left and right margins⟯, it is called ⟮justified⟯. 
In typography, text ⟮being aligned with⟯ ⟮the left margin⟯ is known as ⟮flush left⟯  / ⟮left-aligned⟯. 
In typography, text ⟮being aligned with⟯ ⟮the right margin⟯ is known as ⟮flush right⟯ / ⟮right-aligned⟯. 
⟮Indentation⟯ is ⟮empty space⟯ at ⟮the beginning of the line⟯ (so ⟮it is no longer flush⟯) 
When, e.g. due to ⟮justification⟯, there are ⟮gaps of white space⟯ ⟮running across multiple lines⟯, these are called ⟮rivers⟯. 

##### features

A note is a string placed in a different place than the place it belongs to.
notes most commonly include citation information or comments of some kind
In a wider sense, a note consists of the note proper plus a pair of symbols/strings indicating whence the note, one for the location and one for the note.
In english, it is common to indicate notes with supercripted numerals as ⎴n⎴ or ⎴[n]⎴.
The indication of a note goes after any punctuation mark.
Notes proper are generally gathered in a section just for notes.
There are generally two kind of notes, footnotes and endnotes, depending in which section they are put.
In german, you can call the set of all footnotes the 「Fußnotenapparat」


footnotes|bottom of the page
endnotes|end of chapter/volume/work

#### relationships between pages

##### orphans and widows

flex-container:✫sm_BdflVyb4vu7o0q5hCeBkmu09nMn21opE.jpg✫
⟮Widows⟯ and ⟮orphans⟯ refer to ⟮stranded things⟯. 
⟮Widows and orphans⟯ may either refer to ⟮stranded words⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of paragraphs⟯, or ⟮stranded lines⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of pages⟯. 
There is no agreement on whether ⟮widows or orphans⟯ refers to the things occurring at ⟮the beginnings or ends⟯, that is, ⟮one persons orphan⟯ is ⟮another persons widow⟯. 

#### alternating pages

##### verso and recto

Conceptually, ⟮recto⟯ is ⟮the front of the page⟯, while ⟮verso⟯ is ⟮the back of the page⟯. 
⟮Recto⟯ is ⟮the front of the page⟯ since ⟮you will see it first if reading the book normally⟯, while ⟮verso⟯ is ⟮the back of the page⟯ since ⟮you will only see it once turning the page if reading the book normally⟯. 

###### LtR pages

⟮c+;s2;verso⟯|⟮c+;s1;recto⟯

###### RtL pages

table:span=2;✫recto_verso.svg✫
⟮c+;s3;recto⟯|⟮c+;s4;verso⟯

##### left and right

We can divide pages into left and right pages depending on whether they will appear on the left or right first when reading the book in a normal direction.
In all books, the first page is the cover.
in LtR media, the second page will be a left page, and hence the cover is a right page
in RtL media, the second page will be a right page, and hence the cover is a left page

##### twosided

In latex, to ⟮optimize a document for being two-sided⟯ (e.g. as in a ⟮book⟯), include ⟮twoside⟯ in ⟮the optional argument [] of documentclass⟯
In latex, to ⟮make chapters etc. always open on a right page⟯  include ⟮openright⟯ in ⟮the options [] of documentclass⟯

# graphemes ＆ graphs

## types of graphs

### graphs with phonological realization

logogram/graph ↔ phonogram/graph
logogram|character represents morpheme/word|Kanji/hanzi/hanja/han tu (though there are exceptions); hieroglyphs 
phonogram|character represents one or more phonemes|Latin letters, hangul, kana

Different types of logograms: pictograms, ideograms
Different types of phonographic writing systems: alphabets, syllabaries, abjads, abugidas
Abjads and abugidas may be considered syllabaries (as there is generally a character per syllable) or not (as the characters do not actually repesent languages)

A pictogram depicts the thing it represents by resemblance (or once did).
Examples of pictogram kanji: 日, 月, 山, 木, 口 etc.
An ideogram represents to a more abstract concept
Many ideograms are derived from pictograms.

A syllabogram is a character that (ideally) represents a syllable or mora.
A letter is a character that (ideally) represents a single phoneme.


writing system|consist of characters called|examples
syllabary|syllabogram|hiragana, katakana
alphabet|letters|latin alphabet, greek alphabet

### graphs without phonological realization

#### typographical symbols

##### punctuation

Punctuation is a subset of typographical symbols as well as spacing used to indicate something (such as syntax, pragmatics etc.).
Most logographic systemss as well as japanese do not use whitespace for punctuation.
In japanese, using a question mark is optional when ending a sentence with the interrogative particle か.

###### bangs

Calling the ⟮exclamation point⟯ a ⟮bang⟯ emerged from ⟮printing slang in the 1950s⟯. 
Off ⟮the slang term bang for !⟯ was coined the ⟮interrobang⟯ and the ⟮shebang⟯ 
T⟮he combination of exclamation point and question mark⟯ is known as the ⟮interrobang⟯. 
⟮‽⟯ is called the ⟮interrobang⟯. 

###### dashes

There are two common ⟮dashes⟯ (though there are more uncommon ones), the ⟮en-dash⟯ and the ⟮em-dash⟯. 
⟮dashes⟯ are ⟮longer⟯ than ⟮the hyphen/minus sign⟯. 

######## english

You use ⟮en dashes⟯ to ⟮list things in a range⟯, and sometimes ⟮for some more unwieldy prefixes (Elvis Presley–style, pre–World War II⟯) 
You use ⟮hyphens⟯ to ⟮join⟯/⟮separate⟯ words 
You use ⟮em dashes⟯ to ⟮separate parts of sentences (The new house is said to be beautiful — though if beautiful is the right word, I am not so sure⟯), or ⟮when someone is being interrupted (“Wait! I forgot to tell you—” The door slammed shut between us and I missed whatever she was trying to say.⟯) (and other minor usees) 

###### prime

The ⟮prime⟯ looks similar to ⟮an apostrophe⟯, but ⟮angled to the right⟯. 
The ⟮prime⟯ is often used to ⟮mark something derived from something⟯. 
The ⟮prime⟯ and ⟮double prime⟯ can mark ⟮(arc)minutes⟯ and ⟮(arc)seconds⟯ respectively

### digraphs 

A digraph is using two graphs to write a single phoneme.
Examples of digraphs are sh for /ʃ/ in english.
Digraphs are often combined into ligatures, and as such the term also sometimes refers to those as digraphs.

### ligatures

# writing systems

A writing system is a system to represent language visually.
A writing system uses an inventory of characters.
A writing system may also be known as a script.
An orthography is a set of rules for writing a language.
Digraphia is the situation of having more than one writing system for ⟮the same language⟯

Orthographic depth is the degree of deviation from the ideal correspondence between one character and one referred item (morpheme, syllable, phoneme...)
A phonemic orthography is the special case of an alphabet specifically having no or little orthographic depth.

### letter case

⟮Letter case⟯ is ⟮the distinction between⟯ ⟮uppercase/capital/majuscle and lowercase/minuscle letters⟯. 
⟮uppercase letter⟯ = ⟮captial letter⟯ = ⟮majuscle⟯ 
⟮lowercase letter⟯ = ⟮minuscle⟯  
⟮How⟯ ⟮letter case⟯ ⟮is applied to⟯ ⟮a certain unit (sentences, words, etc⟯) is known as ⟮capitalization⟯. 
⟮Capitalization⟯ is a feature of ⟮(a) orthgraphy⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮bicameral⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮don't have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮unicameral⟯. 
In ⟮bicameral⟯ writing systems, ⟮the uppercase letters⟯ are ⟮generally larger than⟯ ⟮the lowercase letters⟯.

Most commonly, ⟮most words⟯ are considered ⟮major words⟯ and thus ⟮capitalized⟯, while ⟮s13:14;⟮articles⟯, ⟮conjunctions⟯ and ⟮preposititons⟯ are considered ⟮not major words⟯ and thus ⟮not capitalized⟯ (though ⟮s15:18;⟮some, e.g. the AP Style guide,⟯ recommend capitalizing them if ⟮they are four characters or more) ⟯⟯⟯ 

# written media

## manuscripts

A manuscript is a non-printed written work.
Sometimes, the term manuscript is a written work on any media, as long as it is not in its final form.
Before the advent of printing, all books were manuscripts.

### palimpsest

flex-container:✫sm_paste-08cee722aa3a0d331ac53f3027ef7cf35ad457e2.jpg✫
A palimpsest is a manuscript page on which multiple different texts have been written.
For palmipsests, generally the previous layer was erased before the new layer was written, though with varying degrees of success.
Palimpsest as a term is sometimes exteded to refer to any palimpsest-like superimposition.
