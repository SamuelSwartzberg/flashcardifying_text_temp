## types of graphs

### graphs with phonological realization

logogram/graph ↔ phonogram/graph
logogram|character represents morpheme/word|Kanji/hanzi/hanja/han tu (though there are exceptions); hieroglyphs 
phonogram|character represents one or more phonemes|Latin letters, hangul, kana

Different types of logograms: pictograms, ideograms
Different types of phonographic writing systems: alphabets, syllabaries, abjads, abugidas
Abjads and abugidas may be considered syllabaries (as there is generally a character per syllable) or not (as the characters do not actually repesent languages)

A pictogram depicts the thing it represents by resemblance (or once did).
Examples of pictogram kanji: 日, 月, 山, 木, 口 etc.
An ideogram represents to a more abstract concept
Many ideograms are derived from pictograms.

A syllabogram is a character that (ideally) represents a syllable or mora.
A letter is a character that (ideally) represents a single phoneme.

syllabary|syllabogram|hiragana, katakana
alphabet|letters|latin alphabet, greek alphabet

### graphs without phonological realization

#### typographical symbols

##### punctuation

Punctuation is a subset of typographical symbols as well as spacing used to indicate something (such as syntax, pragmatics etc.).
Most logographic systemss as well as japanese do not use whitespace for punctuation.
In japanese, using a question mark is optional when ending a sentence with the interrogative particle か.

###### brackets

thing|name

{{c13::{} }}|⟮curly brackets⟯ (non-us), or ⟮(c:3;curly⟯) ⟮braces⟯ (us, uk)
⟮c+;‹›⟯|⟮angle brackets⟯ or ⟮chevrons⟯
⟮( ) ⟯|⟮brackets⟯ (non-us), ⟮round brackets⟯ (non-us) or ⟮parantheses⟯
⟮[]⟯| ⟮square brackets⟯ (non-us) or ⟮just brackets⟯ (us)


name|referenced entity (US)|referenced entity (not-US)

⟮parentheses⟯|⟮(⟯)|⟮may be meaningless (or US meaning⟯)
⟮brackets⟯|⟮[]⟯, less commonly perhaps ⟮c+;‹›⟯|most commonly ⟮(⟯), also {{c21::cover term for all of ()[]{}‹›}}
⟮braces⟯|{{c12::{} }}|⟮may be meaningless (or US meaning⟯)


###### bangs

Calling the ⟮exclamation point⟯ a ⟮bang⟯ emerged from ⟮printing slang in the 1950s⟯. 
Off ⟮the slang term bang for !⟯ was coined the ⟮interrobang⟯ and the ⟮shebang⟯ 
T⟮he combination of exclamation point and question mark⟯ is known as the ⟮interrobang⟯. 
⟮‽⟯ is called the ⟮interrobang⟯. 

###### dashes

There are two common ⟮dashes⟯ (though there are more uncommon ones), the ⟮en-dash⟯ and the ⟮em-dash⟯. 
⟮dashes⟯ are ⟮longer⟯ than ⟮the hyphen/minus sign⟯. 

######## english

You use ⟮en dashes⟯ to ⟮list things in a range⟯, and sometimes ⟮for some more unwieldy prefixes (Elvis Presley–style, pre–World War II⟯) 
You use ⟮hyphens⟯ to ⟮join⟯/⟮separate⟯ words 
You use ⟮em dashes⟯ to ⟮separate parts of sentences (The new house is said to be beautiful — though if beautiful is the right word, I am not so sure⟯), or ⟮when someone is being interrupted (“Wait! I forgot to tell you—” The door slammed shut between us and I missed whatever she was trying to say.⟯) (and other minor usees) 

###### prime

The ⟮prime⟯ looks similar to ⟮an apostrophe⟯, but ⟮angled to the right⟯. 
The ⟮prime⟯ is often used to ⟮mark something derived from something⟯. 
The ⟮prime⟯ and ⟮double prime⟯ can mark ⟮(arc)minutes⟯ and ⟮(arc)seconds⟯ respectively 

Symbol|Name
⟮′⟯|⟮Prime⟯
⟮″⟯|⟮Double prime⟯

####### tilde

~|tilde


##### whitespace

whitespace is any character or series of characters that represent horizontal or vertical space.

###### horizontal

####### tabs

Multiple spaces used as 'tabs'   Soft tabs
ASCII tab character   hard tabs
In programming, the width of tabs is commonly 2 or 4 spaces.

###### vertical

A blank line is two newlines.

#### emoticons

An ⟮emoticon⟯ represents ⟮a face⟯ using  ⟮typographical characters⟯ 

⟮western⟯ ⟮emoticons⟯ have ⟮faces⟯ that are oriented ⟮left-to-right⟯ 

emoticon eyes|meaning
⟮:⟯|⟮default (more common⟯)
⟮=⟯|⟮default (less common⟯)
⟮8⟯|⟮default (super rare⟯)
⟮%⟯|⟮drunk/confused⟯
⟮X⟯|⟮c+;equivalent of ›‹ eyes, but more often used positively⟯
⟮c+;;⟯|⟮wink⟯


⟮顔文字⟯ (reading ⟮かおもじ⟯ ) have ⟮faces⟯ oriented how ⟮top-to-bottom⟯ 
General pattern for kaomoji:
```
kaomoji ::= ⟮[‹left-arm›]⟯⟮‹head›⟯⟮[‹right-arm›]⟯
⟮hb;((c:30;::head⟯ ::= ⟮[‹left-head›]⟯⟮‹face›⟯⟮[‹right-head›]⟯
⟮hb;⟮face⟯ ::= ⟮[‹left-cheek›]⟯⟮‹eye›[‹nose›]‹eye›⟯⟮[‹right-cheek›]⟯⟯))
```
most common ⟮head delimiters⟯: ⟮(⟯) 

## two or more graphs

### digraphs 

A digraph is using two graphs to write a single phoneme.
Examples of digraphs are sh for /ʃ/ in english.
Digraphs are often combined into ligatures, and as such the term also sometimes refers to those as digraphs.

### ligatures

In writing, a ⟮ligature⟯ is when ⟮two or more characters⟯ are ⟮fused to form a single character⟯. 
Many ⟮current symbols/characters/graphemes⟯ originated as ⟮ligatures⟯, but are now ⟮ordinary characters⟯. 
⟮c+;The ampersand ＆⟯ originated as ⟮a ligature⟯ of ⟮et⟯. 
⟮圕⟯ is ⟮a rare ligature⟯ of ⟮図書館⟯

# writing systems

A writing system is a system to represent language visually.
A writing system uses an inventory of characters.
A writing system may also be known as a script.
An orthography is a set of rules for writing a language.
Digraphia is the situation of having more than one writing system for ⟮the same language⟯

Orthographic depth is the degree of deviation from the ideal correspondence between one character and one referred item (morpheme, syllable, phoneme...)
A phonemic orthography is the special case of an alphabet specifically having no or little orthographic depth.
ortographically deep|English
ortographically shallow|spanish, japanese

## properties

### letter case

⟮Letter case⟯ is ⟮the distinction between⟯ ⟮uppercase/capital/majuscle and lowercase/minuscle letters⟯. 
⟮uppercase letter⟯ = ⟮captial letter⟯ = ⟮majuscle⟯ 
⟮lowercase letter⟯ = ⟮minuscle⟯  
⟮How⟯ ⟮letter case⟯ ⟮is applied to⟯ ⟮a certain unit (sentences, words, etc⟯) is known as ⟮capitalization⟯. 
⟮Capitalization⟯ is a feature of ⟮(a) orthgraphy⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮bicameral⟯. 
Writing systems that ⟮don't have a letter case distinction⟯ are known as ⟮unicameral⟯. 
In ⟮bicameral⟯ writing systems, ⟮the uppercase letters⟯ are ⟮generally larger than⟯ ⟮the lowercase letters⟯.

#### title case

⟮Title case⟯ AKA ⟮headline case⟯ is a style of ⟮capitalization⟯ used for ⟮rendering the titles of published works or works of art⟯ in ⟮English⟯. 
In ⟮title case⟯, ⟮major words (subject to definition⟯) are ⟮capitalized⟯, as are ⟮the first and last word of the title⟯. 
⟮Exact rules of capitalization⟯ in ⟮title case⟯ ⟮vary⟯. 
Most commonly, ⟮most words⟯ are considered ⟮major words⟯ and thus ⟮capitalized⟯, while ⟮s13:14;⟮articles⟯, ⟮conjunctions⟯ and ⟮preposititons⟯ are considered ⟮not major words⟯ and thus ⟮not capitalized⟯ (though ⟮s15:18;⟮some, e.g. the AP Style guide,⟯ recommend capitalizing them if ⟮they are four characters or more) ⟯⟯⟯ 

# written media

## manuscripts

A manuscript is a non-printed written work.
Sometimes, the term manuscript is a written work on any media, as long as it is not in its final form.
Before the advent of printing, all books were manuscripts.

### palimpsest

flex-container:✫sm_paste-08cee722aa3a0d331ac53f3027ef7cf35ad457e2.jpg✫
A palimpsest is a manuscript page on which multiple different texts have been written.
For palmipsests, generally the previous layer was erased before the new layer was written, though with varying degrees of success.
Palimpsest as a term is sometimes exteded to refer to any palimpsest-like superimposition.
