»⟮Socioloinguistics⟯« is the study of ⟮the interaction between⟯ ⟮society and language⟯.
⟮＿dialectology＿⟯ is ⟮a subfield of⟯ ⟮sociolinguistics⟯.
»⟮Dialectology⟯« is the study of ⟮varieties⟯.

# variation

A »⟮variant⟯« is ⟮a different way of saying⟯ ⟮the same thing (something with the same meaning)⟯. 
A »⟮sociolinguistic variable⟯« is ⟮the set of⟯ ⟮＿variants＿⟯ that ⟮mean the same thing⟯.
»⟮Variation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮multiple variants existing (either in general, or for a specific situation)⟯
⟮Exchanging⟯ ⟮a ＿variant＿⟯ ⟮c-;for another⟯ of ⟮the same ＿sociolinguistic variable⟯＿ ⟮changes⟯ ⟮the social meaning⟯, but ⟮c-;not⟯ ⟮the meaning meaning⟯.

⟮variationist sociolinguistics⟯ is ⟮the subfield of⟯ ⟮sociolinguistics⟯ that ⟮studies sociolinguistiv variables specifically⟯.

# varieties

⟮Lect⟯ = ⟮variety⟯
A »⟮variety⟯« is ⟮a version of⟯ ⟮a language⟯.
A ⟮＿variety＿⟯ ⟮limits⟯ ⟮the ＿variants＿ of ＿sociolinguistic variables＿⟯.
^though it's not like any variant has exactly one variant for any sociolinguistic variable.

## language

⟮Language⟯ in common discourse means ⟮standard variety⟯.
⟮Language⟯ in sociolinguistics means something like ⟮set of all relevant varietie⟯s.

## Languoid

»⟮Languoid⟯« is ⟮a cover term⟯ for ⟮language⟯ and ⟮＿variety＿⟯.

## speech communities and varieties

A ⟮＿variety＿⟯ is generally spoken by ⟮a certain ＿speech community＿⟯.
There are ⟮specific terms⟯ for ⟮＿varieties＿⟯ ⟮spoken by ＿certain speech communities＿⟯.


table:type of variety|spoken by speech community defined by
»⟮register/style⟯«|⟮particular communicative setting⟯
»⟮ideolect⟯«|⟮a specific person⟯
»⟮sociolect⟯«|⟮a social group⟯
»⟮c+;s∞;us+3;regiolect⟯«, »⟮c+;s∞;us+2;geolect⟯«, »⟮c+;s∞;us+;topolect⟯«|⟮a specific area⟯
»⟮ethnolect⟯«|⟮ethnic group⟯


⟮register⟯ and ⟮style⟯ are synonyms.
Since ⟮＿registers/style＿⟯s are ⟮defined by a situation⟯, not ⟮c_;a specific group⟯, these are also known as ⟮functional varieties⟯.

## specific varieties

### slang, jargon, cant, argot ...

⟮slang⟯, ⟮jargon⟯, ⟮cant⟯, and ⟮argots⟯ are all ⟮varieties⟯.
⟮slang, jargon, cant, and argots⟯ are all defined mainly by ⟮word choice⟯ ⟮＿variants＿⟯.
⟮The variants⟯ that make up ⟮a certain⟯ ⟮slang, jargon, cant or argot register⟯ are words that have in common that ⟮they are othwerise not in common usage⟯.
It is hard to distinguish ⟮slang, jargon, argot, cant, etc.⟯ because they are ⟮often used interchangeably⟯
»⟮Slang⟯« is typically a ⟮＿register＿⟯ that is ⟮informal⟯ and used in ⟮an in-group setting⟯.
»⟮Jargon⟯« is typically the ⟮＿register＿⟯ of ⟮a certain field⟯.
⟮Cant⟯ ≈ ⟮argot⟯
»⟮Cant/argot⟯« is ⟮＿jargon＿⟯ with the purpose to ⟮exclude or mislead people outside the field.⟯

### AAVE

⟮AAVE⟯ = ⟮African American Vernacular English⟯

# what is being varied?

⟮Pretty much any feature⟯ can be ⟮＿varied＿⟯ to ⟮c_;create ＿variants＿⟯ of ⟮c_;a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

## pronunciation

### accent

An »⟮accent⟯« is ⟮pronunciation⟯ ⟮as a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

## ways of speaking

### sprechbund

A »⟮spr⁑e⁑chbund⟯« is a ⟮＿speech community＿⟯ which has ⟮a shared way of speaking⟯ ⟮going beyond language boundaries⟯ ⟮as a ＿variant＿⟯.

note that unlike a ⟮sprachbund⟯, a ⟮c_;spechbund⟯ doesn't have to be ⟮geographically contiguous⟯, and refers to ⟮speech communities⟯, not ⟮c_;languages⟯, and is generally not ⟮about vocabulary or grammar per se⟯, but ⟮c_;more about a more abstract manner⟯
A ⟮＿sprechbund＿⟯ might e.g. be ⟮hip-hop with the characteristics of rapping, rhyme, and human beatboxing⟯.

# variation in different situations

## accomodation

Speech Acommodation Theory = Communication Accomodation Theory
»⟮Speech/Communication Accommodation Theory⟯« studies ⟮＿acommodation＿⟯ and thus ⟮c_;＿convergence/divergence＿⟯.
»⟮Accomodation⟯« is the process where ⟮participants⟯ ⟮change their way of speaking⟯ according to ⟮c-;the way of speaking⟯ of ⟮other participants in the conversation⟯
⟮＿Acommodation＿ (CAT)⟯ may be ⟮＿convergence＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿divergence＿⟯.
»⟮divergence⟯« is ⟮＿accomodation＿⟯ by ⟮making your speech more ⁑dis⁑similar to the conversational partner's⟯
»⟮convergence⟯« is ⟮＿accomodation＿⟯ by ⟮making your speech more similar to the conversational partner's⟯

## code switching

⟮Code-switching⟯ = ⟮language alternation⟯
»whatever-switching« is ⟮changing between⟯ ⟮2+⟯ ⟮languoids⟯ ⟮in a single conversation⟯


table:-switching|changing between 2+...
»⟮Code-switching⟯«|⟮any languoids⟯
»⟮Style-shifting⟯«|⟮＿styles/registers＿⟯

# which groups adopt the lect

## speech community

A speech community is a group of people who share a common languoid.
The term speech community may more specifically used for a speech community (broad sense) whose memebers share a very specific lect, that is with precise norms, excpectations, etc.
A speech community may be focused or diffuse.
A focused speech community is one where there is agreement about the shared languoid's features
A diffuse speech community is one where there is less/little agreement about the shared languoid's features
Each person belongs to many speech communities.

## diglossia 

Diglossia is the situation where a speech community uses two (or more) langoids for separate purposes.
vernacular variety = L variety 
high/formal/literary variety = H variety
For diglossia usually a L variety and a H exist


table:variety|used in|native speakers
L|everyday situations|native speakers
H|formal situations, literature|no native speakers


文語 (classical japanese) was a H variety during diglossia.

## language and gender

### history

The study of language and gender is said to have stared with Language and Women's Place
Language and Women's Place was written by by Robin Lakoff in 1973 or 1975, its unclear to me.
Robin Lakoff was married to the (arguably) more famous Lakoff (of Metaphors We Live By fame)
Deborah tannen was a student of robin lakoff 
Deborah Tannen wrote You Just Don't Understand in 1990.
You Just Don't Understand initiated the difference approach to language and gender with her book 

### approaches

There are broadly three approaches to explain differences between male and female language.
The three approaches to explain the differences between male and female language are the dominance, deficit and difference approach.
The deficit and dominance approach have in common that they assert that women's language is weaker than men's language.
The deficit approach argues that women's language being weaker causes/perpetuates women's oppression.
The dominance approach argues that women's language being weaker is a reflection of women's oppression.
The difference approach asserts that women's language is not weaker or worse, instead just different from men's language.

### gender in words

Words may have gender in rougly four ways.
The four ways in which words may have gender are lexical gender, grammatical gender, referential gender, social gender.
lexical, grammatical, referential and social gender may contradict each other.

lexical gender is gender as inherent in the reference of words.
lexical gender is most common in kinship terms
Examples for lexically gendered words: Mother, aunt, son, father
social gender is words being gendered via their gender connotations
Examples for social gendered words: surgeon, lawyer is pronominalized by he even when gender is unknown
referential gender is words being gendered via the gender of their deictic referent

#### Mädchen für alles

!If a male person is called a "Mädchen für alles", Mädchen has...


table:gender|feature
lexical gender|female (girl)
grammatical gender|neuter (das Mädchen)
referential gender|male (the deictic referent.)

# how does variation interact with other forces?

## standartization

Standard varity ≈ standard language.
A standard variety is a certain varity of a language.

!The standard variety generally has two properties: 
- !standartized to a certain extent 
- !thought to be/promoted as correct

### how many standard varieties?

Monocentric/pluricentric is about how many standard varieties a language has


table:language|how many standard varieties
monocentric langauge|1
pluricentric langauge|>1 

#### examples

table:centric|language I speak
Monocentric language|Japanese
Pluricentric language|English, German, Spanish 


English is a pluricentric language since it has BE and AE as well as many other standard forms.
Some of the the different standard varieties of german are ⟮Standard german german, standard swiss german, standard austrian german⟯

### auto/heteronomity 

auto/heteronomous is whether a languoid is considered to be a variety of another standard variety.

heteronomous = is a variety of another standard variety
autonomous = is not a variety of another standard variety.

Baviarian is heteronomous in relation to standard german.
A heteronomous language will tend to change towards the standard variety. 

## prestige

Prestige is the level of regard given within a given speech community
Prestige can apply to variants or varieties.
A prestige variety is a variety with high prestige.
Most commonly, standard varieties are prestige varieties.
Covert prestige is the situation in which a non-standard variety has high prestige.

## linguistic prescriptivism

Linguistic prescription is establishing rules for the correct or good use of a language.

### language academies

⟮Language academies⟯ are institutions ⟮regulating standard varieties⟯
Language academies generally follow ⟮linguistic prescriptivism⟯ 
RAE is short for Real Academia Española⟯ 
The ⟮RAE⟯ is the ⟮spanish⟯ ⟮language academy⟯, generally ⟮quite conservative⟯ in outlook 

### dialect

Dialect as a term often implies negative value ('mere dialect').
People very confused may use dialect to mean accent.
In regions such as Italy, France and the Philippines separate but non-standard sister languages to the standard variety are called and (falsely) considered to be dialects.
In an academic setting, a dialect is either a synonym of variety or regiolect.

## language dominance

Language dominance is either the more frequent/ready use of or proficiency in one language more than another.
Language dominance may either be within a given speaker or within a speech community.

## power

Linguistic hegemony is when a dominant group has created a certain idea about their language norms.
Under linguistic hegemony, the dominant's language norms are seen correct.
Under linguistic hegemonic, speech that doesn't conform to the language norms of the dominant group is a failure (being wrong).

In a critical view, english as the standard language in science may be an example of linguistic hegemony
