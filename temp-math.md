## fininfin

finite/infinite sum/product = summation/productation that is finite/infinite
finite/infinite series =syn= finite/infinite sum

## series

infinite series is often just called series
Any ordered finite/infinite sequence can produce a finite/infinite series.
A partial sum is the n first terms of an infinite series.
An infinite series' sum is the value of the limit of the its partial sum as n tends to infinity.
A infinite series is convergent/divergent if its sum does/does not exist.

## continued fraction

A continued fraction is an expression that represents a number through the iteratively repeated process of (1) a⎵n⎵ = ⌊p⌋; (2) r⎵n⎵ = p - a⎵n⎵; (3) a⎵n⎵ + 1/reciprocal(r⎵n⎵) within the numerator.
A continued fraction automatically terminates if reciprocal(r⎵n⎵) is not a fraction.
A finite/infinite continued fraction is a continued fraction which terminate/does not terminate after a finite amount of steps.
A simple/regular continued fraction is a continued fraction where the numerator is 1.
A generalized continued fraction is a continued fraction where the numerator is arbitrary.
Continued fraction notation is representing a number as a continued fraction.
Abbreviated continued fraction notation is representing a number as the sequence of a⎵n⎵s.

## gcd

greatest common divisor =short=> GCD
Synonms: (greatest|highest) common (divisor|factor)
The greatest common divisor of two or more integers is the largest integer that divides each of the integers.

## division by zero

Division by zero is division where the divisor is 0.
In ordinary arithmetic, division by 0 is undefined.
