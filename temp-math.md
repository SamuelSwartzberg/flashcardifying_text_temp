# expressions

An arithmetic expression is an expression that allows only integer constants/coefficients and the elementary arithmetic operations.

An algebraic expression is an expression that allows only integer constants/coefficents, variables, and the algebraic operations.
An algebraic fraction is a fraction whose numberator and denominator are algebraic fractions.
A rational fraction is an algebraic fraction whose numerator and denominator are both polynomials.
A rational expression is an expression that may be rewritten to a rational fraction by using properties of the arithmetic operations.
A rational equation is an equation where the two expressions are rational fractions.
A closed-form expression is an expression whose parts are all finite.

## polynomial

A polynomial expression is expression that allows only integer constants/coefficients, addition, subtraction and multiplication, indeterminates and non-negative interger exponents.
A polynomial is an abstract expression that can be instantiated by a polynomial expression.
Two polynomials define the same polynomial if they can be transformed into each other by use of commutativity, associativity and distributivity (TODO: need cover term).
A polynomial function is a function where 
The standard form of a polynomial is ∑⎵k=0⎵⎴n⎴a⎵k⎵x⎴k⎴.
A polynomial term (rare term) is a term in the standard form of a polynomial.
The degree⎵indeterminate⎵ is the exponent value of an indeterminate.
The degree⎵polynomial term⎵ is the sum of the degres of the indeterminates in the polynomial term.
The degree⎵polynomial⎵ is the highest degree of a polynomial term in a polynomial.

### notation

An arbitrary polynomial =sym=> P
A polynomial function =sym=> P(x)

# algebraic number

A transcendental number is a number that is not an algebraic number.
e.g. e, π


Euler's number =symb=> e

# square root

# equations

A contradiction is an equation with no solution.
A unknown is a variable for which a solution is desired.
A solution is a value for an unknown which makes a conditional equation true.
The solution set is the set of all solutions.
Solving an equation is determining the solution set.
The left/right-hand side are the expressional wffs (TODO change in flashcards) on the left/right-hand side of an equation.

## types

### linear

### quadratic equation

A quadratic equation is any equation that can be rearranged in quadratic equation standard from.
Quadratic equation standard form ::= polynomial with degree 2 = 0

# misc

A variable⎵wide⎵ is a variable⎵narrow⎵ or an indeterminate.
an indeterminate is a variable-like symbol that only stands for itself and is only used as a placeholder for explaining something.
A constant term is a term with no variable⎵wide⎵.
finite/infinite sum/product = summation/productation that is finite/infinite
finite/infinite series =syn= finite/infinite sum

## series

infinite series is often just called series
Any ordered finite/infinite sequence can produce a finite/infinite series.

## continued fraction

A continued fraction is an expression that represents a number through the iteratively repeated process of (1) a⎵n⎵ = ⌊p⌋; (2) r⎵n⎵ = p - a⎵n⎵; (3) a⎵n⎵ + 1/reciprocal(r⎵n⎵) within the numerator.
A continued fraction automatically terminates if reciprocal(r⎵n⎵) is not a fraction.
A finite/infinite continued fraction is a continued fraction which terminate/does not terminate after a finite amount of steps.
A simple/regular continued fraction is a continued fraction where the numerator is 1.
A generalized continued fraction is a continued fraction where the numerator is arbitrary.
Continued fraction notation is representing a number as a continued fraction.
Abbreviated continued fraction notation is representing a number as the sequence of a⎵n⎵s.

## fields

a field is an algebraic structure which is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do.
