# clauses

A clause is a type of constituent one level higher than phrases.
A clause links a predicand (expressed or not) with a predicate (wide sense). 
!^this may not hold in non PIE languages, but I don't have a better definition atm.

## predicate

A predicate (narrow sense) connects the subject to an idea.
A predicate (wide sense) is all of the clause that says something about the subject.
Bill heard Fred -> heard (narrow); heard Fred (wide)

## clausal relationshps

### syntactic

Subordinate clause = dependent clause
A subordinate/dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence.
Independent clause = main clause ≈ root clause ≈ matrix clause
A independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

#### independent clause

##### (null) subjects

A null subject is a unpronounced/elided subject.
A null-subject language is a language which permits null subjects in independent clauses.
An independent clause always features a subject or has a null subject.
Languages I speak that are null-subject languages are spanish and japanese.

#### subordinate clauses

Subordinate clauses correspond to CPs in syntax.
^Thus, they may be adjuncts of the VP or complements of the verb, including in japanese

##### embedded questions

An embedded question is a question that is a subordinate clause.

##### relative clause

A ⟮relative clause⟯ is a ⟮subordinate clause⟯ which ⟮describes the referent of its head⟯.
In indo-european languages, a relative clause is generally introduced by a relative pronoun.
e.g. I met a furry who was passionate.

### semantic

clauses may be linked in various semantic relationships

illative|presents a consequence
cumulative|adds more
adversative|introduces a contrast
disjunctive|selfexpl.
causal|presents a reason
purposive|in order to
conditional|introduce a condition
concessional|admitting, conceding
comparative|comparing
temporal|temporal ordering

## pragmatic effect

### interrogative

In syntax, an interrogative clause has a particular type of syntax and/or prosody, which is typically used to ask question (attach the illocutionary act/force of asking a question).
An interrogative clause is a clause with the pragmatic effect of asking a question.
Interrogative clauses are created using a variety of devices: verbal inflection, word order changes, addition of phrases, special lexemes, phonotactic changes or a combination.
Often, interrogative clauses in writing are indicated graphemically via special punctuation. 

#### conjugation

#### word order

##### english

###### I-to-C movement

In english, wh-questions and yes/no questions alike are marked by I-to-C movement.
In english interrogatives that are not subject questions, the sentence becomes a CP.
In english interrogatives, the newly formed C position is filled by I moving to C.
In english interrogatives, if there is no I to move to C, I is made pronounced via do-support.

###### wh-movement

A wh-question is a interrogative sentence using a wh-word.
Wh-questions typically feature wh-movement.
wh-movement is a form of head movement.
The wh-constituent moves from and therefore its trace is to be found in where it would be in an answer to the question, unless it is in situ.
A wh in situ question is a wh-question where the wh-prhase does not move.
She was reading what? They went where? She spoke to who(m)?
A subject question in english is where the wh-phrase is the subject of the sentence.
Of the wh-questions, subject questions are the only ones that don't feature I to C movement, and thus also no do-support.
the syntax of a subject question has the same syntax as a statement.

Places out of which constituents for wh-questions are impossible to extract   islands
There are a bunch of islands:
- No extraction of one of the conjuncts of a coordinated phrase.
- No extraction out of a CP inside a DP
- No extraction out of a subject (for most English speakers)
- No extraction out of adjuncts
Besides out of islands, wh-movement will be ungrammatical if it does not comply with the shortest move / minimal link condition: The move must be the shortest possible = there must not be a wh-element that would have to move less far.

#### adding constituents

##### tag questsions

A tag question is an interrogative clause which is formed from a declarative clause plus a question tag.
A question tag is an interrogative fragment.
Most languages have an (or multiple) simple question tag(s) allowing for tag question formation.
question tags come in two basic flavors, asking one to confirm or asking one to deny.
Examples of question tags:
en|right?|no?, or no?
de|stimmts?, gell?, wa?, ne?|nicht wahr?, oder nicht?
es|verdad?|no?
English as well as some other languages allow  to the end of a declarative clause to turn it into an interrogative clause.
English as welll as a few other languages have specific grammar for forming more complex tag question fragments, in english: aux + pronoun

##### interrogative words ＆ particles

In english, interrogative words start with wh- and are thus known as wh-words.

## sentences

A sentence consists of one or more clausees.
A simple sentence consists of one (main/independent) clause.
A complex sentence consists of at least one main/independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
A sentence is a constituent cannot be further joined into larger constituents.
A major sentence we might consider a 'normal sentence' following the usual syntactic rules etc.
A minor sentence is a sentence without the usual subject-predicate/constituent structure.
Minor sentences generally do not allow substitution of items of the same word class: Merry Christmas!; *Merry Birthday!
A sentence word (also called a one-word sentence) is a single word that forms a full sentence.

A cleft sentence splits a simple sentence up into a complex sentence. 
Cleft seentence typically put the constituent now in the independent clause into focus.
Syntax of cleft sentences in english: it + conjugated form of to be + X + subordinate clause

# connection

In english, coordination/subordination is most often performed by conjunctions

## coordination

Coordination is the process of linking two things of the same type.
The two things linked via coordination are called conjuncts.
The totality of coordinator(s) and conjuncts forming an instance of coordination is called a coordinate structure.

## subordination

Subordination is linking two things (maincly clauses), where one depends on the other.
A complement clause is an argument of a predicate.
A complementizer turns a clause into the subject or object of a sentence.
In english, the complementizer 'that' sometimes is unpronounced
Akane thought that Lilly was a いい子. ⇒ Akane thought Lilly was a いい子.
