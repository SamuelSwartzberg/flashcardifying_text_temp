# grammatical feature

A grammatical feature is more rarely called grammatical category.
A grammatical feature feature (my term) is a feature in the general sense that encodes a grammatical distinction.
A grammatical feature category is a category consisting of an inventory of grams, of which a language may disinguish some grammemes.
Grammatical feature is ambiguous between gramamtical feature feature and grammatical feature category.
Some languages may not make any distinction within a grammatical feature. 
^i.e., not have it
Grammemes may be encoded lexically, morphologically or syntactically.
Grammemes encode sememes or half of practs/pragmemes.

## encoded by

### nothing

An empty category is an element that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.
An empty category is often indicated by ø or ＊e＊

## encoded in specfic parts of speech

### phi-features (noun-related)

phi-features is a group of grammatical feature categories related to nouns which are encoded morphologically as inflectional paradigms.
Phi-features often force agreement on noun-related things, and sometimes on verbs too.
Phi-features include number, noun class and case.

#### noun class

Noun class is a phi-feature encoding a variety of different semantic distinctions.
Grammatical gender is a type of noun-class system where the grammemes distinguished are male, female, and possibly neuter.

#### number

Grammatical number is a phi-feature encoding sememes of distinctions in amounts.
Grammatical number may be amount number or grouping number

##### amount

Amount number (my term) is grammatical number distinguishing amount.


table:name|amount
Singular|one
Dual|two
Trial|three
Paucal|a few
Plural|many (more than one if only singular/plural)


If a language has amount number, most commonly it only has two grammemes, singular/plural.
In languages with a singular/plural distinction, most often the singular is the unmarked form.

###### grouping

Grouping number (my term) is grammatical number distininguishing distributivity.
The grammemes of grouping number are most commonly singulative and collective.
The collective grammatical number indicates a collective semantic referent.
The singulative grammatical entitity refers to a specific entity.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the collective form is generally the unmarked one.

##### in languages

English, German and Spanish have amount number distinguishing singular/plural.
Japanese does not have grammatical number.

#### case

Grammatical case is a phi-feature encoding semantic relationsip and/or grammatical relation/morphosyntactic alignment.
Grammatical case may be semantic grammatical case or grammatical grammatical case.

##### encoding semantic relationsip

Semantic grammatical case (my term) is grammatical case encoding semantic relationships.
Various possible case grams can overlap, since most languages only realize a handful of them per language as grammemes.

###### movement

table:case|semantic relationship
lative|movement to a location.
ablative|indicates a movement away from a location.
Illative|into
Elative|out of
Inelative|"from inside"
Egressive|beginning of a movement from a location or time ('starting from')
Prolative/vialis/prosecutive/traversal/mediative|by way of, via
perlative|through, across, along

###### location

table:case|semantic relationship
locative|location
Inessive|within
Superessive|on top of, on the surface of.
subessive|below
Pertingent|touching x

###### cause, purpose, means, use

table:case|semantic relationship
benefactive|something is done for the benefit someone/is intended for someone.
Terminative/terminalis|a limit in space/time and/or the goal/target of an action.
Instrumental|a means or tool used or companion present in/while performing an action	
Ornative|endowed with, supplied with
Vocative|adressee


Benefactive case is often included in the dative case.

###### presence, absence

table:case|semantic relationship
Genitive|posess⁑or⁑
Abessive/caritive/privative|absence of the thing.
Comitative|accompaniment

###### comparison, identity

Identical|something is identical to another
Equative|something is the same value as another
Comparative|something is like something (e.g. cold as ice)
Exessive|away from a state
Translative|becoming X, changing to X

###### additional information

The instrumental-comitative case is the common case combining instrumental and commitative cases.
^e.g. english with

### mainly related to verbs

#### grammatical person

Grammatical person is the grammatical feature category that encodes the sememe(s) of personal deixis.
Grammatical person is frequently realized in ⟮personal pronouns⟯ and ⟮verbs⟯, but sometimes also in other places.
Most languages distinguish three forms of grammatical person.
The three values for grammatical person most commonly distinguished are first, second and third person.


table:grammatical person|deictically refers to
First person|The speaker
Second person|The addressee
Third person|neither speaker nor addressee

##### clusivity

Clusivity is a grammatical feature feature which is a subfeature of grammatical person.
Clusivity encodes the difference between two kinds of first person plural reference.
[+inclusive/-exclusive] includes the addressee, [-inclusive/+exclusive] excludes the addressee.

#### tense-aspect-mood

tense-aspect-mood is the combination of tense, aspect and mood.
tense, aspect and mood are all grammatical feature categoriess marked on verbs or VPs.
tense-aspect-mood exists since the three grammatical feature categories are often strongly entangled in a given language and thus hard to separate.
Modality marked on a verb/VP is known as mood, however some authors also treat them as synonyms.

##### tense

##### aspect

Aspect is the grammatical feature category encoding how the event relates to time in general.
Depending on how the grammemes are encoded, aspect may be divided into grammatical aspect and lexical aspect.
Grammatical aspect is aspect encoded in inflectional morphology.
Lexical aspect is aspect encoded in lexical items.

Aspect can be divided into five rough distinctions:
- eventive
- howfar
- spective
- scope
- telicity

###### eventive

Eventive aspect indicates how time flows within the process/event itself.
Language may have some subdivisions of eventive aspect as grammemes, but not have others 
e.g. a language might have perfective, imperfective and stative eventive aspect, but not any of the others

####### division

Eventive
  Perfective
  Imperfective
    Iterative
    Frequentative
    Habitual
    Continuous
      Progressive
      Stative

####### relation

Eventive aspect may be divided into perfective and imperective aspect.
perfective aspect is the event viewed in its entirety ( = without internal complexity).
Imperfective aspect is event viewed with some sort of internal complexity.
Imperfective aspect may sometimes be divided into iterative, frequentative, habitual and continuous (though there may be others)
Habitual, iterative and frequentative aspect all indicate that something is repeated.
Habitual aspect indicates that the action is repeated as one would a habit on different occasions.
Frequentatie aspect indicates that the action is repeated on different occasions, but not necessarily as one would a habit.
Iterative aspect indicates that the action is repeated multiple subsequent times (e.g.knocking (repeatedly), kissing (repeatedly⟯ during the same occasion.
Continuous aspect indicates an ongoing situation/action without interruption.
Continuous aspect may sometimes be divided into progressive and stative.
Progressive aspect is a continuous aspect where the situation/action is evolving/changing.
Stative aspecti is a continuous aspect where the situation/action is not evolving/changing.

####### realizations in languges

Habitual be is a feature of AAVE indicating habitual aspect.
Spanish distinguishes imperfective and perfective verbs in the preterite tense.
In german, 'imperfekt' and 'perfekt' indicate tense, not aspect, despite their names!

###### howfar

howfar aspect (my term) indicates how the state is changing during the specified time.
howfar aspect may be inchoative, cessative or ø.
Inchoative aspect is howfar aspect indicating that something is beginning (however not that something is about to begin).
Cessative aspect is howfar aspect indicating that something is ending.

###### prospective/retrospective

The spective (my term) aspect indicates when an event takes place relative to the reference time.
spective aspective may be prospective, retrospective, or ø.
Prospective aspect is spective aspect indicating that an event occurs subsequent to a reference time.
Retrospective aspect is spective aspect indicating that an event occurs before a reference time.
Retrospective aspect is commonly but confusingly also called perfect aspect, not to be confused with perfective aspect.

###### gnomic/episodic

The scope aspect (my term) indicates what kind of scope something being the fact has.
Scope aspect may be gnomic, episodic, or ø.
Gnomic aspect is the scope apsect indicating general truths.
Episodic aspect is the scope aspect indicating truths that are temporally bounded.

###### telic/atelic

Telicity is the grammatical feature (mostly seen as an aspect) of whether something has a specific endpoint.
Telicity may be telic, atelic, or ø.

##### modality

modality is a grammatical feature category encoding possible situations. 
Different forms of modality are sometimes called flavors.

###### deontic/epistemic, realis/irrealis

Modalities are primarily distingished along two axes: deontic/epistemic and realis/irreals
Deontic modality is modality that is concerned with how the world ought to be.
Epistemic modality is modality that is concerned with knowledge/belief/credence.
Realis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is the case.
Irrealis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is somehow not the case.
Distinction between different types of modality may not always be clear-cut, since different languages use different analyses.

###### realis epistemic

Most (but not all) languages have a single realis mood/modality called the indicative mood/modality.

Possible epistemic realis modalitites are energetic, gnomic or the various evidential modalites.
Energetic is an epistemic realis mood indicating emphasis or strong belief.
Gnomic is an epistemic realis mood indicating general truths or aphorisms. 

####### evidentiality

Evidentiality (wide sense) is the grammatical feature category encoding what kind of evidence there is for a given statement.
Evidentiality (wide sense) is most commonly analyzed as a mood.
Evidential = verificational = validational
An evidential is a feature that encodes evidentiality (wide sense).

The typology of evidentiality (wide sense) was mainly created by Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004, 2006).
There are two kinds of evidentiality (wide sense): indirectivity and evidentiality proper.
Indirectivity is sometimes called type I, evidentiality type II.
Indirectivity is the type of evidentiality (wide sense) that encodes whether evidence exists, but not what kind.
Evidentiality proper is the type of evidentiality (wide sense) that encodes what kind of evidence exists.

######## evidentiality proper

Evidentiality proper contains a certain number of grammatical feature features.
Most languages build evidentials proper grammemes from a combination of the various grammatical feature features of evidentiality proper.
The grammatical feature features making up the grammatical feature cateogory evidentiality proper are [+/- witness], [+/- firsthand/secondhand/thirdhand], [+/- sensory], [+/- inferential], [+/- reportative], [+/- assumed].
The evidentiality proper grammatical feature feature [+/- sensory] may sometimes contain subfeatures [+/- visual] or [+/- auditory]
The reportative proper grammatical feature feature [+/- sensory] may sometimes contain subfeatures [+/- hearsay] or [+/- quotativve]

###### irrealis epistemic

The common epistemic irrealis modalities are subjunctive, potential, dubitative, speculative, hypothetical, assumptive


table:epistemic irrealis modality|meaning
Subjunctive|something is unlikely, this is generally used in subordinate clauses.
Conditional|Something is a dependent on another thing.
Tentative|something is likely
Dubitative|something is dubious/doubtful or uncertain.
Speculative|something is mere speculation.
Hypothetical|while something did not happen, it could have happened.
Assumptive|something is true because it is usually true in similar circumstances


The tentative mood is more commonly called potential, but this is a different meaning than the potential in japanese 

###### deontic

Deontic modality may be roughly dividend into commissive, directive and volitive.


table:type of deontic modality|meaning
commmissive|commital to something
directive|commands, requests, etc.
volitive|wishes, desires etc.

####### directive

table:type of directive modality|meaning
Permissive|something is permitted
Imperative|command
Hortative|encouraging/discouraging an action
Prohibitive/vetative|that something is prohibited.
Propositive|proposal or suggestion.
Propositive|that something should be brought about.

####### volitive

table:type of volitive modality|meaning
Desiderative|one has a desire for something
Optative|event is hoped for

###### epistemic

Mirative is an epistemic modality indicating surprise/unpreparedness in relation to a given thing
Causative is an epistemic modality indicating that someone/thing causes someone/thing else to do/be something.
Causative modality increases the valency of the verb involved.

## thing encoded

### (half of) practs

#### honorific

A honorific is a grammatical feature category that encodes half of practs related to social relationships.
Honorifics may encode formality, social distance, politeness, humillity, deference, or respect, depending on the language.
Honorifics may be realized via a variety of linguistic devices.

##### T-V

The T-V distinction (wide) is a honorific distinction realized in pronouns.
The T-V distinction (narrow) is a honorific distinction realized in two different second-person pronouns.
The T-V distinction is common in many Indo-European languages, but not english.
The name T-V distinction comes from latin tu/vos.

#### interrogation

An interrogative word is a lexeme used to create an interrogative sentence.
An interrogative particle is an interrogative word that is a particle and converts the sentence into a yes-no question.
Interrogatives may be instantiated by different parts of speech.


### sememes

#### polarity

Polarity is a grammatical feature category & feature feature that encodes the difference between positive and negative polarity.
Positive/negative polarity may encode truth/falsity and/or confirmation/denial.
There may be separate polarity grammemes for truth/falsity and confirmation/denial grammemes, or grammemes may be ambiguous between them.
Positive polarity = affirmation
Negative polarity = negation


#### posessive

A posessive is a grammeme indicating posession.
Posessives may be instantiated via lexemes or inflectional/derivational morphemes.
Inflectional morphology instantiating a posessive are genitive/posessive case.
Lexemes instatiating a posessive are most commonly possessive determiners, pronouns and verbs.
Examples for posessive verbs are to have, haben, tener.
In quite a few languages, the job of  a posessive verb is done by existential verbs.
e.g. 金⁑ある⁑よ, hessian dialectal german: das ist mir.

#### numerals

A numeral is a grammeme that describes a numerical quantity.
Numerals are instantiated by lexemes, more precisely via derivational morphology.
Numerals internally often consist of some morpheme(s) indicating the quantity, and some morpheme(s) the type of numeral.
In most languages, lexemes instantating numerals are either determiners, adverbs or nouns.

##### classifier

A classifier is a morpheme or lexeme that puts a noun into a category based on its referent.
A measure word is a classifier that appears with a numeral.
Measure words are margial in indo-european languages.
An example for an english measure word is piece of x, e.g. three pieces of paper.
In east asian languages, measure words are often required.

TODO: Better integration, also include:  The number together with its numeral classifier is called a numeral quantifier in the literature. (JP), http://web.mit.edu/norvin/www/24.902/numq.html

##### kinds of numerals

The type of numeral is what way of looking at the counted things is being chosen.
The type of numeral may ordinal, cardinal, a multiplier, distributive, collective, partitive...


table:type of numeral|indicates|example
ordinal|position in sequence
cardinal|amount/quantity
multipliers|how often should something be multiplied|-fold (e.g. sevenfold), -ce (e.g. thrice)
distributive numerals|how may times each|-ly (e.g. triply)
collective numerals|sets of certain sizes|-ad (e.g. triad)
partivtive|fractions|-th

##### counting systems

Numerals are generally based on one or more counting systems.
A counting system is the numeral system a language uses.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases, and stop counting every power of 10 at different numbers: most commonly at 1000 or at 10 000 (myriad)
due to the practice of wrapping at 10 000, 10 000 is used in many sinosphere languages to mean a lot, and most commonly 10k years = a long life.

#### deixis

Demonstratives are lexemes encoding spatial/discourse deixis sememes.
Demonstratives are most frequently determiners or pronouns.


# information structure

Information structure is the grammeme indicating the relationship of the current thing to larger discourse.
A topic-prominent language is one that places encoding information structure in a high priority in the syntax, ofte featuring explicit morphology for marking information structure.
Japanese, mandarin, korean are all topic-prominent.
Topic is a synonym for theme.
The theme is that information that is being talked about.
The rheme is what is being said about the theme.
Topicalization is marking something as the theme by fronting it.
// subjects are generally topics in unmarked languages, so subject drop is also topic drop (Song, 2017) (which also seems like a good introduction on information structure -> this here is incomplete, see there for more)


# arguments

## counting arguments

Verbs have 0 or more arguments.
Valency is the amount of arguments a verb has.
Transitivity is the amount of non-subject arguments a verb has.
Valency = Transitivity + 1 
An ambitransitive verb is one with a transitivity of 0 or 1 (may take an argument or not)

### terminology

Words counting valency are formed with numeral (both latinate and greek are used) + valent
e.g. mono/univalent, divalent, trivalent, tetra/quadrivalent...
Words counting transitivity are formed with numeral (both latinate and greek are used) + transitive

## morphosyntactic alignment

Morphosyntactic alignment is concerned with the distribution of case (incl. word order, but only if it is case-marking) over different valencies.
Morphosyntactic alignment typically varies by language, not within a language.
For the purpose of morphosyntactical alignment, we will consider valencies 1-3 and thus max. three arguments A1, A2, A3
A1, A2, A3 for the purposes of morphosyntactic alignment do not need to be ordered in that way in word order, though they may often have some kind of typical word order.

### A1 A2

Consider verbs with a valency of 1 or 2 and thus 1-2 arguments A1, A2.


valency|nominative-accusative|ergative-absolutive|direct|tripartite|transitive
1|A1=C1|A1=C1|A1=C1|A1=C1|A1=C1
2|A1=C1, A2=C2|A1=C2, A2=C1|A1=C1, A2=C1|A1=C2, A2=C3|A1=C2, A2=C2

Typically, A1 is the agent (sometimes called experiencer in the case of intransitive verbs) while A2 is the patient, though languages often allow deviating from that.
No language can be fully direct or transitive in its alignment, as languages need some way to tell A1 and A2 of a verb with valency = 2 apart.

#### case 

##### ergative-absolutive

table:Case number|case name
C1|absolutive case
C2|ergative case


Because C2 marks A1 of divalent verbs in ergative-absolutive languages and A1 of divalent verbs most often is the agent, it is often said that C2 marks the agent of divalent verbs.
ergative-absolutive is often shortened to ergative.

##### nominative-accusative

table:case number|case name
C1|nominative case
C2|accusative case


In nominative-accusative languages, typically the nominative case is unmarked.
A marked nominative morphsynalign is a nominative-accusative morphsynalign where the nominative case is marked and the accusative case is unmarked.
nominative-accusative is often shortened to accusative.

##### direct

table:case number|case name
C1|direct

##### tripartie

table:case number|case name
C1|intransitive case
C2|ergative case
C3|accusative case

##### transitive

table:case number|case name
C1|intransitive case
C2|transitive case

#### more complex

##### split

A language with split morphosyntactic alignment has different morphosyntactic alignments under different circumstances (syntactic, grammatical, morphological, etc.)
Split ergative alignment is split morphosyntactic alignment between nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive.

##### active

Active alignment has two cases C1, C2 for A1, A2, of v=2 and A1 of v=1 sometimes gets C1 and sometimes C2.
Typically, active alignment decides whether A2 of v=1 gets C1 or C2 based on the agenthood of A1.
There are two types of languages with active alignment, split-S and fluid-S.
split-S and fluid-S are named that way because what I usually call A1 of v=1 is more commonly called S.
Split-S languages have the presumed agenthood of A1 of v=1 calcified into two classes of verbs, which require C1 or C2 respectively.
Fluid-S languages allow speaker choice as to the choice of case of A1 to indicate agenthood.

### A2 A3

alignment|v=2|v=3
dative|A2=CI|A2=CII, A3=CI
dechticaetiative|A2=CI|A2=CI, A3=CII

If v=3, typically A2 is the patient, and A3 is the theme.

#### cases

for both dative and dechticaetiative, CI is whatever the case of A2 was for v=2 (see other level of alignments).
CII is dative for languages with dative morphosyntactic alignment.
CII is dechticaetative for languages with dechticaetative morphosyntactic alignment.
In the case of dative morphsynalign, A2 is called direct and A3 indirect object.
In the case of dechticaetative morphsynalign, A2 is called primary and A3 secondary object.
dative morphsynalign=indirective morphsynalign
dechticaetiative morphsynalign=secundative morphsynalign
Primarily dative langauges often still feature some dechticaetiative behavior.

### merging

oblique case =syn= objective case
The oblique case is an argument-marking case that is not C1 (e.g. nominative or absolutive).
Thus, for nom-accus dative morphsynalign the oblique case can be said to merge dative and accusative cases.
English features an oblique case.

### realization

The most common types of morphosyntactic alignments (narrow) are nominative-accusative followed by ergative-absolutive.
Dative morphsynalign is more common than dechticaetiative.
All languages I speak are nominative-accusative languages.

## semantic roles in monovalent verbs

an unergative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is an agent 
^the most common case
an unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is not an agent.

## voice

Voice is a grammatical feature category which changes the valency of a verb and thus semantic roles of the arguments.
Demoting an argument is dropping it or realizing it in some less central way
Passivelike voices are voices which decrease the valency by demoting an argument.
The passive voice is the passivelike voice for nominative-accusative languages which demotes A1 and A2->A1 (thus C2->C1)
The antipassive voice is the passivelike voice for ergative-absolutive languages which demotes A2 and A1->A1 (thus C2->C1)
For both the passive and antipassive voice, the item that is not demoted keeps its thematic role.
Thus, the passive voice can also be said to make the subject into a patient.
The middle voice is a passivelike voice where A1 is both the agent and the patient.

encoding the mapping semantic roles related to agency over grammatical relations.
Grammatical voice is generally realized on verbs/VPs.
The two most common grammatical voices are active and passive.
In the active voice, the subject is the agent.
In the passive voice, the subject is not the agent (e.g. patient, them)
The mediopassive voice is a grammatical voice that merges the middle voice and the passive voice.
The impersonal passive voice reduces the valency of an intransitive verb to zero.



The generative grammar/chomskyan approach is to see an object as the DP complement of a verb.
