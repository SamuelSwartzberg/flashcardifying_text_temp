# grammatical feature

A grammatical feature is more rarely called grammatical category.
A grammatical feature feature (my term) is a feature in the general sense that encodes a grammatical distinction.
A grammatical feature category is a category consisting of an inventory of grams, of which a language may disinguish some grammemes.
Grammatical feature is ambiguous between gramamtical feature feature and grammatical feature category.
Some languages may not make any distinction within a grammatical feature. 
^i.e., not have it
Grammemes may be encoded lexically, morphologically or syntactically.
Grammemes encode sememes or half of practs/pragmemes.

## encoded by

### nothing

An empty category is an element that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.
An empty category is often indicated by ø or ＊e＊

## encoded in specfic parts of speech

### phi-features (noun-related)

phi-features is a group of grammatical feature categories related to nouns which are encoded morphologically as inflectional paradigms.
Phi-features often force agreement on noun-related things, and sometimes on verbs too.
Phi-features include number, noun class and case.

#### noun class

Noun class is a phi-feature encoding a variety of different semantic distinctions.
Grammatical gender is a type of noun-class system where the grammemes distinguished are male, female, and possibly neuter.

#### number

Grammatical number is a phi-feature encoding sememes of distinctions in amounts.
Grammatical number may be amount number or grouping number

##### amount

Amount number (my term) is grammatical number distinguishing amount.


table:name|amount
Singular|one
Dual|two
Trial|three
Paucal|a few
Plural|many (more than one if only singular/plural)


If a language has amount number, most commonly it only has two grammemes, singular/plural.
In languages with a singular/plural distinction, most often the singular is the unmarked form.

###### grouping

Grouping number (my term) is grammatical number distininguishing distributivity.
The grammemes of grouping number are most commonly singulative and collective.
The collective grammatical number indicates a collective semantic referent.
The singulative grammatical entitity refers to a specific entity.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the collective form is generally the unmarked one.

##### in languages

English, German and Spanish have amount number distinguishing singular/plural.
Japanese does not have grammatical number.

#### case

Grammatical case is a phi-feature encoding semantic relationsip and/or grammatical relation/morphosyntactic alignment.
Grammatical case may be semantic grammatical case or grammatical grammatical case.
Grammatical grammatical case encodes the relationships of arguments to the verb.
^and thus which exist depend on the morphosyntactic alignment of the language.

##### semantic grammatical case

Semantic grammatical case (my term) is grammatical case encoding semantic relationships.
Various possible case grams can overlap, since most languages only realize a handful of them per language as grammemes.

###### movement

table:case|semantic relationship
lative|movement to a location.
ablative|indicates a movement away from a location.
Illative|into
Elative|out of
Inelative|"from inside"
Egressive|beginning of a movement from a location or time ('starting from')
Prolative/vialis/prosecutive/traversal/mediative|by way of, via
perlative|through, across, along

###### location

table:case|semantic relationship
locative|location
Inessive|within
Superessive|on top of, on the surface of.
subessive|below
Pertingent|touching x
Intrative|"amidst"

###### cause, purpose, means, use

table:case|semantic relationship
benefactive|something is done for the benefit someone/is intended for someone.
Terminative/terminalis|a limit in space/time and/or the goal/target of an action.
Instrumental|a means or tool used or companion present in/while performing an action	
Ornative|endowed with, supplied with
Vocative|adressee


Benefactive case is often included in the dative case.

###### presence, absence

table:case|semantic relationship
Genitive|posess⁑or⁑
Abessive/caritive/privative|absence of the thing.
Comitative|accompaniment

###### comparison, identity

table:case|semantic relationship
Identical|something is identical to another
Equative|something is the same value as another
Comparative|something is like something (e.g. cold as ice)
Exessive|away from a state
Translative|becoming X, changing to X

###### additional information

The instrumental-comitative case is the common case combining instrumental and commitative cases.
^e.g. english with, though that's obv not a case.

### mainly related to verbs

#### grammatical person

Grammatical person is the grammatical feature category that encodes the sememe(s) of personal deixis.
Grammatical person is frequently realized in ⟮personal pronouns⟯ and ⟮verbs⟯, but sometimes also in other places.
Most languages distinguish three forms of grammatical person.
The three values for grammatical person most commonly distinguished are first, second and third person.


table:grammatical person|deictically refers to
First person|The speaker
Second person|The addressee
Third person|neither speaker nor addressee

##### clusivity

Clusivity is a grammatical feature feature which is a subfeature of grammatical person.
Clusivity encodes the difference between two kinds of first person plural reference.
[+inclusive/-exclusive] includes the addressee, [-inclusive/+exclusive] excludes the addressee.

#### tense-aspect-mood

tense-aspect-mood is the combination of tense, aspect and mood.
tense, aspect and mood are grammatical feature categoriess marked on verbs or VPs.
tense-aspect-mood exists as a grouping since the three grammatical feature categories are often strongly entangled in a given language and thus hard to separate.

##### tense

Tense may be split into absolute and strict relative tense (though this is complicated, as discussed below).

###### absolute tense

Absolute tense is the time of the action relative to the present.
The possible absolute tenses are past, present and future.
Some languages only distinguish two absolute tenses.
Languages which only distinguish two absolute tenses have either past/nonpast or future/nonfuture.
There are some languages which lack absolute tense completely, though this is rather are.

###### relative tense

strict relative tense is the time of the action relative to a specific point in time. 
strict relative tense can also be analyzed as spective aspect.
anterior tense (strict relative tense) = retrospective aspect (spective aspect)
posterior tense (strict relative tense) = prospective aspect (spective aspect)

###### combinations

Absolute relative tense is the combination of absolute tense and strict relative tense.
relative tense is ambiguous between strict relative tense and absolute relative tense.

pluperfect =short= plusquamperfct
pluperfect =syn= past perfect
past perfect = past absolute tense + retrospective aspect
future perfect = future absolute tense + retrospective aspect
future in the past = past absolute tense + prospective aspect
future in the future (??? - doesn't seem to exit) = future absolute tense + prospective aspect


##### aspect

Aspect is the grammatical feature category encoding how the event relates to time in general.
Depending on how the grammemes are encoded, aspect may be divided into grammatical aspect and lexical aspect.
Grammatical aspect is aspect encoded in inflectional morphology.
Lexical aspect is aspect encoded in lexical items.

!Regarding meaning encoded, aspect can be divided into
- !eventive
- !howfar
- !spective
- !scope
- !telicity

###### eventive

Eventive aspect indicates how time flows within the process/event itself.
While eventive aspects can be ordered hierarchically, languages may have some aspects deep into the tree while not having others.
e.g. a language might have perfective, imperfective and stative eventive aspect, but not any of the others

####### outline

```
!Eventive
!  Perfective
!  Imperfective
!    Iterative
!    Frequentative
!    Habitual
!    Continuous
!      Progressive
!      Stative
```

####### relation

Eventive aspect may be divided into perfective and imperective aspect.
perfective aspect is the event viewed in its entirety ( = without internal complexity).
Imperfective aspect is event viewed with some sort of internal complexity.

######## imperfect

Imperfective aspect may sometimes be divided into iterative, frequentative, habitual and continuous (though there may be others)
Habitual, iterative and frequentative aspect all indicate that something is repeated.
Habitual aspect indicates that the action is repeated as one would a habit on different occasions.
Frequentative aspect indicates that the action is repeated on different occasions, but not necessarily as one would a habit.
Iterative aspect indicates that the action is repeated multiple subsequent times (e.g.knocking (repeatedly), kissing (repeatedly⟯ during the same occasion.
Continuous aspect indicates an ongoing situation/action without interruption.

######### continuous

Continuous aspect may sometimes be divided into progressive and stative.
Progressive aspect is a continuous aspect where the situation/action is evolving/changing.
Stative aspecti is a continuous aspect where the situation/action is not evolving/changing.

####### realizations in languges

Habitual be is a feature of AAVE indicating habitual aspect.
Spanish distinguishes imperfective and perfective verbs in the preterite tense.
In german, 'imperfekt' and 'perfekt' indicate tense, not aspect, despite their names!

###### howfar

howfar aspect (my term) indicates how the state is changing during the specified time.
howfar aspect may be inchoative, cessative or ø.
Inchoative aspect is a howfar aspect indicating that something is beginning (however not that something is about to begin).
Cessative aspect is a howfar aspect indicating that something is ending.

###### prospective/retrospective

spective aspect (my term) indicates when an event takes place relative to the reference time.
spective aspective may be prospective, retrospective, or ø.
Prospective aspect is a spective aspect indicating that an event occurs subsequent to a reference time.
Retrospective aspect is a spective aspect indicating that an event occurs before a reference time.
Retrospective aspect is commonly but confusingly also called perfect aspect.
^not to be confused with perfective aspect

###### gnomic/episodic

scope aspect (my term) indicates what kind of scope something being the fact has.
Scope aspect may be gnomic, episodic, or ø.
Gnomic aspect is a scope aspect indicating general truths.
Episodic aspect is a scope aspect indicating truths that are temporally bounded.

###### telic/atelic

Telicity is the aspect of whether something has a specific endpoint.
Telicity is sometimes also analyzed as something else than a aspect.
Telicity may be telic, atelic, or ø.

##### modality

modality is a grammatical feature category encoding possible situations. 
Modality marked on a verb/VP is known as mood, however some authors also treat them as synonyms.
Different forms of modality are sometimes called flavors.

###### deontic/epistemic, realis/irrealis

Modalities are primarily distingished along two axes: deontic/epistemic and realis/irreals
Deontic modality is modality that is concerned with how the world ought to be.
Epistemic modality is modality that is concerned with knowledge/belief/credence.
Realis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is the case.
Irrealis moods/modalities are a set moods/modalities that indicate that something is somehow not the case.
Some modalities are ambiguous between being realis/irrealis and/or deontic/epistemic.
Distinction between different types of modality may not always be clear-cut.


###### realis epistemic

Most (but not all) languages have a single realis mood/modality called the indicative mood/modality.

Possible epistemic realis modalitites are energetic, gnomic or the various evidential modalites.
Energetic is an epistemic realis mood indicating emphasis or strong belief.
Gnomic is an epistemic realis mood indicating general truths or aphorisms. 

####### evidentiality

Evidentiality (wide sense) is the grammatical feature category encoding what kind of evidence there is for a given statement.
Evidentiality (wide sense) is most commonly analyzed as a realis epistemic modiality.
Evidential =syn= verificational =syn= validational
An evidential is a feature that encodes evidentiality (wide sense).

The typology of evidentiality (wide sense) was mainly created by Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004, 2006).
There are two kinds of evidentiality (wide sense): indirectivity and evidentiality proper.
Indirectivity is sometimes called type I, evidentiality type II.
Indirectivity is the type of evidentiality (wide sense) that encodes whether evidence exists, but not what kind.
Evidentiality proper is the type of evidentiality (wide sense) that encodes what kind of evidence exists.

######## evidentiality proper

Evidentiality proper contains a certain number of grammatical feature features.
Most languages build evidentials proper grammemes from a combination of the various grammatical feature features of evidentiality proper.
The grammatical feature features making up the grammatical feature cateogory evidentiality proper are [+/- witness], [+/- firsthand/secondhand/thirdhand], [+/- sensory], [+/- inferential], [+/- reportative], [+/- assumed].
The evidentiality proper grammatical feature feature [+/- sensory] may sometimes contain subfeatures [+/- visual] or [+/- auditory]
The reportative proper grammatical feature feature [+/- sensory] may sometimes contain subfeatures [+/- hearsay] or [+/- quotativve]

###### irrealis epistemic

The common epistemic irrealis modalities are subjunctive, potential, dubitative, speculative, hypothetical, assumptive


table:epistemic irrealis modality|meaning
Subjunctive|something is unlikely, this is generally used in subordinate clauses.
Conditional|Something is a dependent on another thing.
Tentative|something is likely
Dubitative|something is dubious/doubtful or uncertain.
Speculative|something is mere speculation.
Hypothetical|while something did not happen, it could have happened.
Assumptive|something is true because it is usually true in similar circumstances


The tentative mood is more commonly called potential, but this is a different meaning than the potential in japanese 

###### deontic

Deontic modality may be roughly dividend into commissive, directive and volitive.


table:type of deontic modality|meaning
commmissive|commital to something
directive|commands, requests, etc.
volitive|wishes, desires etc.

####### directive

table:type of directive modality|meaning
Permissive|something is permitted
Imperative|command
Hortative|encouraging/discouraging an action
Prohibitive/vetative|that something is prohibited.
Propositive|proposal or suggestion

####### volitive

table:type of volitive modality|meaning
Desiderative|one has a desire for something
Optative|event is hoped for

###### epistemic

Mirative is an epistemic modality indicating surprise/unpreparedness in relation to a given thing.
Causative is an epistemic modality indicating that someone/thing causes someone/thing else to do/be something.
Causative modality increases the valency of the verb involved.

## thing encoded

### (half of) practs

#### honorific

A honorific is a grammatical feature category that encodes half of practs related to social relationships.
Honorifics may encode formality, social distance, politeness, humillity, deference, or respect, depending on the language.
Honorifics may be realized via a variety of linguistic devices.

##### T-V

The T-V distinction (wide) is a honorific distinction realized in pronouns.
The T-V distinction (narrow) is a honorific distinction realized in two different second-person pronouns.
The T-V distinction is common in many Indo-European languages, but not english.
The name T-V distinction comes from latin tu/vos.

### sememes

#### polarity

Polarity is a grammatical feature category ＆ feature feature that encodes the difference between positive and negative polarity.
Positive/negative polarity may be truth/falsity and/or confirmation/denial.
There may be separate polarity grammemes for truth/falsity and confirmation/denial grammemes, or grammemes may be ambiguous between them.
Positive polarity =syn= affirmation
Negative polarity =syn= negation


#### posessive

A posessive is a grammeme indicating posession.
Posessives may be instantiated via lexemes or inflectional/derivational morphemes.
Inflectional morphology instantiating a posessive is genitive/posessive case.
Lexemes instatiating a posessive are most commonly possessive determiners, pronouns and verbs.
Examples for posessive verbs are to have, haben, tener.
In quite a few languages, the job of  a posessive verb is done by existential verbs.
e.g. 金⁑ある⁑よ, hessian dialectal german: das ist mir.

#### numerals

A numeral is a grammeme that describes a numerical quantity.
Numerals are instantiated by lexemes, more precisely via derivational morphology.
Numerals internally often consist of some morpheme(s) indicating the quantity, and some morpheme(s) the type of numeral.
In most languages, lexemes instantating numerals are either determiners, adverbs or nouns.

##### classifier

A classifier is a morpheme or lexeme that co-occurs with another element based on that element being part of a certain semantic class.
A measure word is a classifier that appears with a numeral.
^perhaps there are no other classifiers than measure words, in which case they would be synonymous
A numeral quantifier is the combination of a numeral and a measure word.

###### in languages

in indo-european languages, measure words are uncommon.
An example for an english measure word is piece of x, e.g. three pieces of paper.
In east asian languages, measure words are often required.

##### kinds of numerals

A numeral may be divided into the numeric value and the type of numeral.
The type of numeral is the wway of looking at the numeric value.
The type of numeral may be ordinal, cardinal, a multiplier, distributive, collective, partitive.
The type of numeral may be indicated morphologically or in some other way.

table:type of numeral|indicates|example
ordinal|position in sequence
cardinal|amount/quantity
multipliers|how often should something be multiplied|-fold (e.g. sevenfold), -ce (e.g. thrice)
distributive numerals|how may times each|-ly (e.g. triply)
collective numerals|sets of certain sizes|-ad (e.g. triad)
partivtive|fractions|-th

##### counting systems

The numeric value of a numeral is generally based on one or more counting systems.
A counting system is the numeral system a language uses.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases.
The reuse point (my term) is at which powers of the base a counting system starts reusing terms for bases.
In indo-european languages, the reuse point is 10⎴3⎴.
In east asian languages, the reuse point is 10⎴4⎴.
Because the reuse point in east asian languages is 10⎴4⎴ = 10000, 10000 is used to mean 'a lot'.

#### deixis

Demonstratives are lexemes encoding spatial/discourse deixis sememes.
Demonstratives are most frequently determiners or pronouns.
