## structuralism

### history

『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』 is a book by ⟮de Sassure⟯ and was published in ⟮1916⟯
⟮De Sassure⟯ founded ⟮structuralism⟯ in the book 『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』.
⟮Structuralism⟯ lies at the base of ⟮emic units⟯ and thus of ⟮linguistics⟯.
Outside of ⟮linguistics⟯, ⟮structuralism⟯ had ⟮its heyday⟯ in ⟮the 1950s and 1960s⟯ in ⟮France⟯ (but is still influential) 

### signs

#### semiotics

»⟮semiosis⟯« is ⟮activity/process involving signs⟯ 
»⟮semiotics⟯« is the study of ⟮＿semiosis＿⟯

### the sign

»⟮A sign⟯« consists of ⟮the connection between⟯ ⟮＿a signfier＿ and ＿a signified＿⟯.
I will define »⟮sign component⟯« as ⟮＿a cover term＿⟯ for ⟮either ＿sign＿, ＿signifer＿ or ＿signified＿⟯.
»⟮The sign compnent type⟯« is ⟮either sign, signifier or signified.⟯
The »⟮sign component type set⟯« is ⟮the set of⟯ ⟮＿all sign components＿⟯ of ⟮＿the sign component type＿⟯.
A ⟮＿sign component＿⟯ ⟮gains its meaning⟯ by⟮ contrast with⟯ ⟮all other members of the ＿sign component type set＿⟯.
The ⟮＿sign component type set＿⟯ ⟮starts out as⟯ ⟮an undifferentiated mass⟯, ⟮c-;which is then⟯ ⟮divided into⟯ ⟮a finite number of ＿sign components＿⟯.
So, the meaning of a signifier ⟮horse⟯ is ⟮¬{x ∈ S⎵signifier⎵⟯} | ⟮x ≠ horse}⟯
The ⟮＿sign＿⟯ is ⟮arbitrary⟯ because ⟮any ＿signified＿⟯ ⟮could have been signified by a different ＿signifier＿⟯. 
Since the ⟮＿sign＿⟯ consists of ⟮the two parts of ＿signifier＿ and ＿signified＿⟯, the model is often called ⟮dyadic⟯.

#### nesting

⟮Barthes⟯ took ⟮Sassures sign⟯ and ⟮nested it.⟯ 
⟮Derrida⟯ then took ⟮Barthes sign⟯ and realized that it ⟮could be nested infinitely⟯ in ⟮both directions⟯
⟮The endless nesting of signs⟯ creates ⟮an endless deferrment of meaning⟯
»⟮Différance⟯« is ⟮the endless deferrment of meaning⟯ due to ⟮the endless nesting of signs⟯.
