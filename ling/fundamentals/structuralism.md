## structuralism

### history

『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』 is a book by ⟮de Sassure⟯ and was published in ⟮1916⟯
⟮De Sassure⟯ founded ⟮structuralism⟯ in the book 『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』.
⟮Structuralism⟯ lies at the base of ⟮emic units⟯ and thus of ⟮linguistics⟯.
Outside of ⟮linguistics⟯, ⟮structuralism⟯ had ⟮its heyday⟯ in ⟮the 1950s and 1960s⟯ in ⟮France⟯ (but is still influential) 

### signs

#### semiotics

»⟮semiosis⟯« is ⟮activity/process involving signs⟯ 
»⟮semiotics⟯« is the study of ⟮＿semiosis＿⟯

### the sign

#### semiotic cake

A semiotic topic is what the semiotic layer is 'about'.
A semiotic cake is a undifferentiated mass of everything about the semiotic topic.
A semiotic divider is an arbitrary boundary separating a semiotic cake into semiotic divisions
A semiotic division is a part of a semiotic cake, no matter if it is a semiotic component or not yet.
A semiotic component is a semiotic division that we will take as a fundamental unit of semiotic cake.
The semiotic component meaning is the semiotic component's meaning, which is ¬ all other semiotic components.
// something something contrastive/negative meaning
A semiotic component set is the set of semiotic components of a given semiotic cake.

#### signifiers and signifieds

The signifier and signified cakes are two specific semiotic cakes arbitrarily chosen.
The signifier and signified cakes give rise to signifier/signified dividiers, components and component sets.

#### the sign

A sign is the arbitrary linking of a signifier and a signified.
A divided semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set is a semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set that was created by dividing up a semiotic cake.
The signifier/signified topic/cake/divider/component/component set is a divided semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set.
An emergent semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set is a semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set that was created by merging semiotic components.
By joining signs, we give rise to a new sign topic/cake/divider/component/component set.
The sign topic/cake/divider/component/component set is an emergent semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set.

#### whole universe

The sign/signifier/sigified whole is everything about the relevant sign/signifier/signified.
The sign universe whole is everthing about the relevant sign/signified/signifier whole in total.
The sign universe topic/cake/divider/component/component set is all of the sign/signifier/signifieds topic/cake/divider/component/component set. 

#### further notes

If one just says sign/signifier/signified, most commonly sign/signifier/signified component is meant.
One can say a sign signifies/is signified by its signified/signifier component
Since the ⟮＿sign＿⟯ consists of ⟮the two parts of ＿signifier＿ and ＿signified＿⟯, the model is often called ⟮dyadic⟯.

#### nesting

⟮Barthes⟯ took ⟮Sassures sign⟯ and ⟮nested it.⟯ 
⟮Derrida⟯ then took ⟮Barthes sign⟯ and realized that it ⟮could be nested infinitely⟯ in ⟮both directions⟯
⟮The endless nesting of signs⟯ creates ⟮an endless deferrment of meaning⟯
»⟮Différance⟯« is ⟮the endless deferrment of meaning⟯ due to ⟮the endless nesting of signs⟯.
