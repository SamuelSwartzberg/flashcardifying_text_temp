# compositing

## basics

Compositing (my term) is the creation of a composite element by means of one or more compositing mechanisms.
A composite element (my term) is an element created by compositing.

## compositing mechanisms

»⟮A compositing mechanism⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮n ＿compositing ingredients＿⟯ and ⟮＿a compositing pprocess＿⟯.
The compositing mechanism result is the item produced by a compositing mechanism.
A complex compositing mechanism is the application of one or more compositing mechanisms recursively.

## compositing ingredients

A compositing ingredient (my term) is a part of a composite element ≈ a thing used in a compositing mechanism.
A heart is a compositing ingredient that is somehow fundamental.

## compositing pprocess

### basics

compositing processing process =short=&gt; compositing pprocess
A compositing pprocess is the method of combining or modifying the compositing ingredients.
A compositing pprocess may be catenative, compending, modification or replacement.

### type

#### catenative

»⟮A catenative compositing pprocess⟯« is a compositing pprocess that consists of ⟮adding/removing n catenative items⟯ at a certain catenative position(s)
A concatenative/discatenative compositing pprocess is a catenative compositing pprocess that adds/removes.

##### things

A catenative item is a thing that is added or removed in a catenative compositing pprocess.
A concatenative/discatenative item is a catenative item in concatenation/discatenation.
A null=zero concatenative/discatenative item is a concatenative/discatenative item without a phonetic form/realization.

##### position

The catenative position is where a catenative item is attached/removed relative to the heart.
A catenative position identifier is a name for a certain catenative positon.

#### compending

A compending compositing process is a compositing process that involves combining two or more compend parts.
A compend is the result of the compending compositing process.
A compend part is a heart used in a compend.
The compend head is the compend part which becomes the new heart of the resulting compend.

##### head

TODO head ↔ heart
The compend head is ambiguous between semantic head, syntactic head, and morphological head.
»⟮The semantic head⟯« is ⟮the compend part⟯ ⟮of which ＿the compend＿ is ＿a hyponym＿ of, if any⟯.
»⟮The syntactic head⟯« is ⟮the compend part⟯ that ⟮determines ＿the word class＿ of ＿the compend＿⟯.
»⟮The morphological/inflectional head⟯« is ⟮the compend part⟯ on ⟮which ＿inflection＿ is marked⟯.

##### whence meaning

An endocentric/exocentric compend is a compend that does/does not have a semantic head.
»⟮A metonymical compend ⟯«is ⟮＿a compend＿⟯ where ⟮＿the compend parts＿⟯ ⟮identify ＿a sememe＿ ＿metonymically＿⟯.
»⟮A copulative compend⟯« is ⟮＿a compend＿⟯ where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ is ⟮c_;the intersection of⟯ ⟮＿the sememes＿ of ＿the compend parts＿⟯ (or roughly so).

#### other

The modification/replacement compositing pprocess is changing/replacing the heart.

## paradigms

A paradigm is the set of composite elements that share a heart.

## specific compositing mechanisms

### concatenating

#### basics

possible ⟮＿concatenative items＿⟯ = {⟮＿affix＿⟯, ⟮＿adposition＿⟯, ⟮＿clitic＿⟯}

#### typical catenative position morpheme 

##### definition

The typical catenative position morpheme is the morpheme shared by most catenative position identifiers

##### mapping

after heart|post-|enclitic, sometimes suffix
before or after heart|ambi-|sometimes adfix
within heart|in-|mesoclitic
