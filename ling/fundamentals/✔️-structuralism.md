## history

『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』 is a book by ⟮de Sassure⟯ and was published in ⟮1916⟯
⟮De Sassure⟯ founded ⟮structuralism⟯ in the book 『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』.
⟮Structuralism⟯ lies at the base of ⟮emic units⟯ and thus of ⟮linguistics⟯.
Outside of ⟮linguistics⟯, ⟮structuralism⟯ had ⟮its heyday⟯ in ⟮the 1950s and 1960s⟯ in ⟮France⟯ (but is still influential) 

## signs

### semiotics

»⟮semiosis⟯« is ⟮activity/process involving signs⟯ 
»⟮semiotics⟯« is the study of ⟮＿semiosis＿⟯

## the sign

### semiotic cake

»⟮A semiotic topic⟯« (my term) is ⟮what the semiotic layer is 'about'⟯.
»⟮A semiotic cake⟯« (my term) is ⟮an undifferentiated mass⟯ of ⟮everything about ＿the semiotic topic＿⟯.
»⟮A semiotic divider⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿an arbitrary boundary＿⟯ ⟮separating⟯ ⟮＿a semiotic cake＿⟯ ⟮c-;into⟯ ⟮＿semiotic divisions＿⟯
»⟮A semiotic division⟯« (my term) is ⟮a part of ＿a semiotic cake＿⟯, ⟮no matter if⟯ it is ⟮＿a semiotic component＿⟯ or ⟮c_-;not⟯.
»⟮A semiotic component⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a semiotic division＿⟯ that we will take as ⟮a fundamental unit of⟯ ⟮＿semiotic cake＿⟯.
»⟮The semiotic component meaning⟯« is ⟮＿the semiotic component＿'s meaning⟯, which is ⟮¬ all other ＿semiotic components＿⟯.
»⟮A semiotic component set⟯« (my term) is ⟮the set of ＿semiotic components＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿semiotic cake＿⟯.

### signifiers and signifieds

»⟮The signifier/signified topics⟯« (my term) are ⟮two specific ＿semiotic topics＿⟯ ⟮arbitrarily chosen⟯.
⟮＿The signifier/signified topics＿⟯ ⟮give rise to⟯ ＿⟮signifier/signified⟯ ⟮cakes/dividiers/components/component sets⟯＿.

### the sign

»⟮A sign component⟯« is ⟮the arbitrary linking⟯ of ⟮＿a signifier component＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿a signified component＿⟯.
»⟮A divided semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set＿⟯ that was created by ⟮dividing up ＿a semiotic cake＿⟯.
»⟮The signifier/signified topic/cake/divider/component/component set⟯« is ⟮＿a divided semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set＿⟯.
»⟮An emergent semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set＿⟯ that was created by ⟮merging ＿semiotic components＿⟯.
By ⟮creating ＿sign components＿⟯, we give rise to a new ⟮＿sign topic/cake/divider/component/component set＿⟯.
»⟮The sign topic/cake/divider/component/component set⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿an emergent semiotic topic/cake/divider/component/component set＿⟯.

### whole universe

»⟮The sign/signifier/sigified whole⟯« (my term) is ⟮everything about⟯ ⟮the relevant sign/signifier/signified⟯.
»⟮The sign universe whole⟯« (my term) is ⟮everthing about⟯ ⟮the relevant ＿sign＿, ＿signified＿ & ＿signifier whole＿⟯ ⟮c_-;in total⟯.
»⟮The sign universe topic/cake/divider/component/component set⟯« (my term) is ⟮all of the ＿sign＿, ＿signifier＿ & ＿signifieds＿⟯ ⟮topic/cake/divider/component/component set⟯. 

### further notes

If one just says ⟮sign/signifier/signified⟯, most commonly ⟮＿sign/signifier/signified component＿⟯ is meant.
⟮＿A sign component＿⟯ »⟮signifies/is signified by⟯« ⟮its ＿signified/signifier component＿⟯
Since the ⟮＿sign＿⟯ consists of ⟮the two parts of ＿signifier＿ and ＿signified＿⟯, the model is often called ⟮dyadic⟯.

»⟮A simply nested sign⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a sign component＿⟯ ⟮nested as ＿the signifier component＿⟯ of ⟮c_-;another ＿sign component＿⟯, introduced by ⟮Barthes⟯.
»⟮A infinitely nested sign⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿simply nested signs＿⟯ being ⟮nested infintely⟯, introduced by ⟮Derrida⟯.
»⟮Différance⟯« is ⟮the endless deferrment of meaning⟯ in ⟮＿infinitely nested signs＿⟯.
