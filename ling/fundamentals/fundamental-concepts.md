# fundamental concepts

## units

### emic/etic

»⟮An emic unit⟯« is ⟮an abstract unit⟯ of ⟮a number of⟯ ⟮variant forms⟯.
»⟮An etic unit⟯« is ⟮a variant form⟯ of ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯.
⟮Various types of⟯ ⟮＿emic/etic units＿⟯ exists for ⟮different fields/concerns⟯.
⟮＿Emic units＿⟯ carry ⟮the name of ＿the etic unit＿⟯, ⟮suffixed with -eme⟯.
»⟮An alternant⟯« is a ⟮different⟯ ⟮＿etic unit＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same emic unit＿⟯.
^However, alternant is often only used for allomorphs
»⟮Alternation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ ⟮c_-;existing⟯.
⟮Two ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯ are »⟮allowhatevers⟯«.


table:emic unit|etic unit-
⟮phoneme⟯|⟮phone⟯
⟮morpheme⟯|⟮morph⟯
⟮grapheme⟯|⟮glyph⟯
⟮phraseme⟯|⟮phrase⟯
⟮sememe⟯|⟮seme⟯
⟮pragmeme⟯|⟮pract⟯
⟮lingueme⟯|⟮ling⟯
⟮grammeme⟯|⟮gram⟯
⟮lexical unit/lexeme⟯|⟮lex⟯
⟮kineme⟯|⟮kine⟯|(body language)


Often, the morpheme {gram} is actually used as a synonym for {graph} instead of for grammeme-related things

#### exprs

Importantly, etic units are still in some sense abstract, they are not exprs.
A exprs (my term) is an instantiation of an etic unit.
Alternatively, an expr is one of the infinite set of things that are grouped into an etic unit.
^e.g. saying a sound, writing a glyph....

#### distribution

»⟮The etic environment⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮before and after the target ＿etic unit＿⟯.
⟮＿free variation＿⟯ and ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯ are the states ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ can be in if ⟮they appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯ is the state ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ must be in if ⟮they don't appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
»⟮Free variation⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮do not have ＿emic contrast＿⟯.
»⟮Contrastive distribution⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮have ＿emic contrast＿⟯
In ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, ⟮changing between two ＿etic units＿⟯ is ⟮impossible (since they never appear in the same etic environment)⟯ and thus ⟮the idea of ＿emic contrast＿ does not apply⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯, they ⟮are ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯, they ⟮are not ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, they ⟮may or may not be ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
Ergo ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮without ＿emic contrast＿⟯ may still ⟮be part of different ＿emic units＿⟯ if they are ⟮very dissibilar etically⟯.

»⟮Emic contrast⟯« is when ⟮changing one ＿etic unit＿ for another⟯ alters ⟮the resulting ＿emic unit＿⟯.
⟮contrastive⟯ = ⟮emic⟯
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ are »⟮emic/contrastive⟯« if they are ⟮in ＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
»⟮A minimal pair⟯« is ⟮two or more ＿lexical units＿⟯ that are ⟮the same⟯ ⟮except for one positio⟯n, which is in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
Finding ⟮a ＿minimal pair＿⟯ ⟮proves⟯ that ⟮the two ＿etic units＿ involved⟯ are ⟮part of different ＿emic units＿⟯.
⟮＿Emic contrast＿⟯ has been »⟮neutralized⟯« when ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ appear i⟮n an ＿etic environment＿⟯ in which ⟮they are no longer ＿contrastive＿⟯.
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯ may still be ⟮＿variants＿ of a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

#### inventory & system

An emic inventory is the set of emic units that are contrastive.
^e.g. phonemic inventory, graphemic inventory
An emic system is the combination of an emic inventory and an emic rule set.
In graphemics, the graphemic system is actually called a writing sytem.
^e.g. phonemic system, morphemic system
An emic rule set is the set of rules governing the emic inventory in the languoid.
^e.g. phonemic rule set

#### study

Whateveremics is the study of whatever from an emic perspective.
^e.g. graphemics
Whateveretics is the study of whatever from an etic perspective.
As an exception, the study of phonology is typically called phonology, not phonemics.
Whateverics (my term) is the study of whatever.
Ergo, whateverics is the conver term of whateveremics and whateveretics.

#### tactics

whatevertactics is the part of whateveremics that deals with whatevertactic constraints.
^e.g. phonotactics, morphotactics, graphotactics
A whatevertactic constraint is a rule for the (im)permissible combinations of whateveremes.
^e.g. phonotactic constraint, morphotactic constraint

#### perspective

whateveremic/whateveric are used to refer to looking at something from the perspective of emic/etic units.

#### other levels

An emic unit »⟮encodes⟯« one or more emic units from another emic system.
An emic unit may be encoded by a lower emic system or by a physical medium.
The encoding emic unit(s) is/are the higher emic unit encoding the current emic unit. 
The encoded emic unit(s) is/are the lower emic unit encoding the current emic unit. 
A higher emic system is an emic system es1 that encodes another emic system es2.
A lower emic system is an emic system es1 that is encoded by another emic system es2.
A higher/lower emic unit is a emic unit of a higher/lower emic system.
The whateveremically encoded item (rare term in most cases) is the linguistic unit(s) encoded by the whatevereme.
^e.g. graphemically encoded item

### things

»⟮A linguistic unit⟯« is ⟮a generic name⟯ for ⟮an element⟯ which ⟮may form a sequence with others of its kind⟯.
A speech linguistic unit is a linguistic unit produced in speech,
Speech linguistic units are phonemes, phones, syllables, consonants, vowels.
^A linguistic unit may be e.g. phoneme, morpheme, phraseme, grapheme, syllable...
»⟮A segment⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic unit＿⟯ of which ⟮we're not sure which linguistic unit it is⟯, or ⟮for which it is irrelevant⟯.
»⟮A lingueme⟯« is ⟮any whatevereme⟯ which ⟮can be independently learned and transmitted⟯.
»⟮A linguistic item⟯« is ⟮any linguistic thing under analysis⟯.

#### whatever

A whatevereme is any possible emic unit.
Whatever is the cake that the relevant emic unit and etic unit share.
A whatevereme is the emic unit of whatever.
A whatevere is the etic unit of whatever.

### feature

»⟮A feature⟯« is a ⟮binary⟯ ⟮value⟯.
Featural is looking at a thing from the perspective of features.

#### emic units

⟮＿An emic unit＿⟯ can be ⟮analyzed⟯ ⟮into multiple ＿features＿⟯, instead of ⟮into ＿etic units＿⟯.
»⟮An emic unit⟯« is (under a certain analysis) ⟮an unique combination of⟯ ⟮＿features＿⟯.
»⟮A feature matrix⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿features＿⟯ that ⟮characterize a particular ＿emic unit＿⟯.

#### notation

⟮＿A feature＿⟯ is indicated by ⟮[‹name›]⟯.
⟮＿A feature＿⟯'s ⟮states⟯ are indicated by ⟮[+ ‹name›]⟯ and ⟮c_;[- ‹name›]⟯

#### grouping

A feature class is a set of features, feature categories or feature classes that are expressing a common thing.
A top-level feature class (my term) is a feature class that is not part of a larger feature class.
A feature category (rare term) is a feature that can take on multiple values.
Alternatively, we can analyze a feature category as a set of features that together give rise to multiple values.
^The difference between a feature class and a feature category is that a emic unit can have multiple features from a feature class, while a feature category is mutually exclusive.

#### instances

table:emic unit|analyzable into...
⟮sememe⟯|⟮semantic feature⟯
⟮phoneme⟯|⟮distinctive feature⟯
grammeme|grammatical feature

#### polysemy

In a more vague sense, »⟮a feature⟯« may also be ⟮any linguistically salient property⟯ of ⟮a languoid⟯.

### sequences

»⟮A string⟯« is most commonly assumed to be ⟮a string of words⟯, but may also be a synonym for ⟮sequence of any linguistic unit⟯.
»⟮A sequence of linguistic units⟯« is ⟮a series of these linguistic units⟯ with ⟮no claim as to compositionality⟯.

### combination

The »⟮principle of compositionality⟯« is that ⟮the meaning⟯ of ⟮an expression⟯ can ⟮be determined by⟯ ⟮c_-2;the meaning⟯ of ⟮its constituent parts⟯ and ⟮rules to combine them⟯.

## ways things can exist

### markedness

According to ⟮Haspelmath (2005)⟯, ⟮markedness⟯ has ⟮12 distinctive senses⟯, which makes it ⟮pretty hard to use unambiguously⟯.
⟮Most but not all⟯ senses of ⟮markedness⟯ share ⟮a feeling of oddness⟯
A ⟮marked⟯ form, ⟮across most of the⟯ senses, is more ⟮rare⟯.

### implicational scale

flex-container:✫implicational-scale-color-terms.png✫✫implicational-scale-grammar-irish.jpg✫


⟮Implicational scale⟯ = ⟮implicational hierarchy⟯
If a thing exsists »⟮⟮implicational scale⟯⟯«, if ⟮one thing is present⟯, ⟮all the things⟯ ⟮lower on the scale⟯ ⟮will be as well⟯
If a thing is on an ⟮＿implicational scale＿⟯, and we find that ⟮the e.g. 5th stage is present⟯, we would expect to also find ⟮all four lower stages to be present⟯.

## structuralism

### history

『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』 is a book by ⟮de Sassure⟯ and was published in ⟮1916⟯
⟮De Sassure⟯ founded ⟮structuralism⟯ in the book 『⟮Course in General Linguistics⟯』.
⟮Structuralism⟯ lies at the base of ⟮emic units⟯ and thus of ⟮linguistics⟯.
Outside of ⟮linguistics⟯, ⟮structuralism⟯ had ⟮its heyday⟯ in ⟮the 1950s and 1960s⟯ in ⟮France⟯ (but is still influential) 

### signs

#### semiotics

»⟮semiosis⟯« is ⟮activity/process involving signs⟯ 
»⟮semiotics⟯« is the study of ⟮＿semiosis＿⟯

### the sign

»⟮A sign⟯« consists of ⟮the connection between⟯ ⟮＿a signfier＿ and ＿a signified＿⟯.
I will define »⟮sign component⟯« as ⟮＿a cover term＿⟯ for ⟮either ＿sign＿, ＿signifer＿ or ＿signified＿⟯.
»⟮The sign compnent type⟯« is ⟮either sign, signifier or signified.⟯
The »⟮sign component type set⟯« is ⟮the set of⟯ ⟮＿all sign components＿⟯ of ⟮＿the sign component type＿⟯.
A ⟮＿sign component＿⟯ ⟮gains its meaning⟯ by⟮ contrast with⟯ ⟮all other members of the ＿sign component type set＿⟯.
The ⟮＿sign component type set＿⟯ ⟮starts out as⟯ ⟮an undifferentiated mass⟯, ⟮c-;which is then⟯ ⟮divided into⟯ ⟮a finite number of ＿sign components＿⟯.
So, the meaning of a signifier ⟮horse⟯ is ⟮¬{x ∈ S⎵signifier⎵⟯} | ⟮x ≠ horse}⟯
The ⟮＿sign＿⟯ is ⟮arbitrary⟯ because ⟮any ＿signified＿⟯ ⟮could have been signified by a different ＿signifier＿⟯. 
Since the ⟮＿sign＿⟯ consists of ⟮the two parts of ＿signifier＿ and ＿signified＿⟯, the model is often called ⟮dyadic⟯.

table:What?|Where in the image?
⟮a sign⟯|⟮the are between any two dotted lines⟯
⟮the arbitrary dividing point of sings⟯|⟮the dotted lines⟯
⟮the masses of signifier and signifieds⟯|⟮the wavy areas⟯


#### nesting

flex-container:✫infinitely-nested-sign.jpg✫✫nested-sign.jpg✫


⟮Barthes⟯ took ⟮Sassures sign⟯ and ⟮nested it.⟯ 
⟮Derrida⟯ then took ⟮Barthes sign⟯ and realized that it ⟮could be nested infinitely⟯ in ⟮both directions⟯
⟮The endless nesting of signs⟯ creates ⟮an endless deferrment of meaning⟯
»⟮Différance⟯« is ⟮the endless deferrment of meaning⟯ due to ⟮the endless nesting of signs⟯.

## what is language?

### language

»⟮A language⟯« is a ⟮specific kind⟯ of ⟮structured⟯ ⟮communication system⟯.
»⟮Language⟯« (⟮ability⟯) is the ability to ⟮use (a) language(s) to communicate⟯.
»⟮Language⟯« (⟮occurence⟯) is ⟮an instance of⟯ use of ⟮language (ability)⟯.

### language modality

»⟮language modality⟯« is by what ⟮＿language (occurence)＿⟯ is ⟮produced⟯ and ⟮c_;percieved⟯.
There are three common ⟮＿language modalities＿⟯: ⟮＿oral-auditory＿⟯, ⟮＿visual-gestural＿⟯, ⟮＿manual-visual＿⟯ (my term).
»⟮Speech⟯« is  ⟮＿language produced/production＿⟯ with the ⟮＿oral-auditory＿⟯ ⟮＿language modality＿⟯.
»⟮Sign⟯« is ⟮＿language produced/production＿⟯ via the ⟮＿visual-gestural＿⟯ ⟮＿language modality＿⟯.
»⟮Writing⟯« is ⟮＿language produced/production＿⟯ via the ⟮＿manual-visual＿⟯ ⟮＿language modality＿⟯.
⟮＿Speech/sign/writing＿⟯ may be ⟮a manner of production⟯ or ⟮the ＿language (occurence)＿ thereby produced⟯.
»⟮A sign/spoken/written language⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮designed to be⟯ ⟮produced via ＿sign/speech/writing＿⟯. 
⟮＿Sign＿ ＆ ＿speech＿⟯ consist(s) of ⟮phones⟯ and ⟮c_;phonemes⟯.
⟮＿Writing＿⟯ consist(s) of ⟮glyphs⟯ and ⟮c_;graphemes⟯.

### language porduction.

»⟮Language production⟯« is ⟮the process⟯ of ⟮c_;production⟯ of ⟮＿language (occurence)＿⟯.
⟮＿Language production＿⟯ consists of ⟮＿conceptualization＿⟯, ⟮＿encoding＿⟯, and ⟮＿expression＿⟯.
»⟮Speech production⟯« is the form of ⟮＿language production＿⟯ where ⟮＿expression＿⟯ is done via ⟮＿speech＿⟯.

## perspective

### langue and parole

flex-container:✫round-sign-structuralism.jpg✫✫planes-sound-thought.png✫


As regards languoids, ⟮De Sassure⟯ created the distinction between ⟮langue⟯ and ⟮c_;parole⟯. 
⟮＿langue and parole＿⟯ are about ⟮what we're talking about when⟯ we ⟮say language (or, well, languoid)⟯
»⟮Langue⟯« is ⟮the structuralist system⟯ of a given languoid 
»⟮Parole⟯« is ⟮all instances of the use⟯ of a languoid

!Sassure claims that in the ⟮langue⟯ of ⟮spoken language⟯
- !the ⟮＿signified＿⟯ is ⟮the concept⟯
- !the ⟮＿signifier＿⟯ is ⟮(the psychological reality of) the phonological realization⟯. 

### synchronic/diachronic

As regards viewpoints, ⟮De Sassure⟯ created the distinction between ⟮＿synchronic and diachronic＿⟯.
⟮＿Synchronic and diachronic＿⟯ are two perspectives we can take on related to ⟮how we care about⟯ ⟮the history of a language⟯ in ⟮c-;our analysis⟯.
A »⟮synchronic⟯« viewpoint considers a languoid⟮ at a moment in time without taking its history into account⟯.
A »⟮diachronic⟯« approach considers a languoid⟮'s history⟯.
If we're being structuralist, a synchronic approach specifically consideres the structuralist system of a languoid.
