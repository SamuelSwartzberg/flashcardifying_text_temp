# units

## emic/etic

»⟮An emic unit⟯« is ⟮an abstract unit⟯ of ⟮a number of⟯ ⟮variant forms⟯.
»⟮An etic unit⟯« is ⟮a variant form⟯ of ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯.
⟮Various types of⟯ ⟮＿emic/etic units＿⟯ exists for ⟮different fields/concerns⟯.
⟮＿Emic units＿⟯ carry ⟮the name of ＿the etic unit＿⟯, ⟮suffixed with -eme⟯.
»⟮An alternant⟯« is a ⟮different⟯ ⟮＿etic unit＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same emic unit＿⟯.
^However, alternant is often only used for allomorphs
»⟮Alternation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ ⟮c_-;existing⟯.
⟮Two ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯ are »⟮allowhatevers⟯«.

### various units

table:emic unit|etic unit-
⟮phoneme⟯|⟮phone⟯
⟮morpheme⟯|⟮morph⟯
⟮grapheme⟯|⟮glyph⟯
⟮phraseme⟯|⟮phrase⟯
⟮sememe⟯|⟮seme⟯
⟮pragmeme⟯|⟮pract⟯
⟮lingueme⟯|⟮ling⟯
⟮grammeme⟯|⟮gram⟯
⟮lexeme⟯|⟮lex⟯
lexeme unit|lex unit
⟮kineme⟯|⟮kine⟯|(body language)

#### name details & polysemy

Often, the morpheme {gram} is actually used as a synonym for {graph} instead of for grammeme-related things.
What I call lexeme unit is more commonly called lexical unit.
lexical item =syn=lexical unit.

#### representation

table:e units|representation
lexeme, lexeme unit|all caps (EXAMPLE)

#### derived units

A sememopragmeme is a sememe or a pragmeme.
A semopract is a seme or a pract.

### exprs

Importantly, etic units are still in some sense abstract, they are not exprs.
A exprs (my term) is an instantiation of an etic unit.
Alternatively, an expr is one of the infinite set of things that are grouped into an etic unit.
^e.g. saying a sound, writing a glyph....

### distribution

»⟮The etic environment⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮before and after the target ＿etic unit＿⟯.
⟮＿free variation＿⟯ and ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯ are the states ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ can be in if ⟮they appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯ is the state ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ must be in if ⟮they don't appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
»⟮Free variation⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮do not have ＿emic contrast＿⟯.
»⟮Contrastive distribution⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮have ＿emic contrast＿⟯
In ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, ⟮changing between two ＿etic units＿⟯ is ⟮impossible (since they never appear in the same etic environment)⟯ and thus ⟮the idea of ＿emic contrast＿ does not apply⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯, they ⟮are ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯, they ⟮are not ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, they ⟮may or may not be ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
Ergo ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮without ＿emic contrast＿⟯ may still ⟮be part of different ＿emic units＿⟯ if they are ⟮very dissibilar etically⟯.

»⟮Emic contrast⟯« is when ⟮changing one ＿etic unit＿ for another⟯ alters ⟮the resulting ＿emic unit＿⟯.
⟮contrastive⟯ = ⟮emic⟯
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ are »⟮emic/contrastive⟯« if they are ⟮in ＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
»⟮A minimal pair⟯« is ⟮two or more ＿lexical units＿⟯ that are ⟮the same⟯ ⟮except for one positio⟯n, which is in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
Finding ⟮a ＿minimal pair＿⟯ ⟮proves⟯ that ⟮the two ＿etic units＿ involved⟯ are ⟮part of different ＿emic units＿⟯.
⟮＿Emic contrast＿⟯ has been »⟮neutralized⟯« when ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ appear i⟮n an ＿etic environment＿⟯ in which ⟮they are no longer ＿contrastive＿⟯.
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯ may still be ⟮＿variants＿ of a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

### inventory & system

An emic inventory is the set of emic units that are contrastive.
^e.g. phonemic inventory, graphemic inventory
The lexemic unit inventory is more commonly called the lexis.
An emic system is the combination of an emic inventory and an emic rule set.
The graphemic system is more commonly called a writing system.
^e.g. phonemic system, morphemic system
An emic rule set is the set of rules governing the emic inventory in the languoid.
^e.g. phonemic rule set

### study

Whateveremics is the study of whatever from an emic perspective.
^e.g. graphemics
Whateveretics is the study of whatever from an etic perspective.
Whateverics (my term) is the study of whatever.
Ergo, whateverics is the conver term of whateveremics and whateveretics.

#### variant names

The study of phonemes is typically called phonology, not phonemics.
The study of phrasemes is typically called phraseology, not phrasemics.

### tactics

whatevertactics is the part of whateveremics that deals with whatevertactic constraints.
^e.g. phonotactics, morphotactics, graphotactics
A whatevertactic constraint is a rule for the (im)permissible combinations of whateveremes.
^e.g. phonotactic constraint, morphotactic constraint

### perspective

whateveremic/whateveric are used to refer to looking at something from the perspective of emic/etic units.

### other levels

An emic unit »⟮encodes⟯« one or more emic units from another emic system.
An emic unit may be encoded by a lower emic system or by a physical medium.
The encoding emic unit(s) is/are the higher emic unit encoding the current emic unit. 
The encoded emic unit(s) is/are the lower emic unit encoding the current emic unit. 
A higher emic system is an emic system es1 that encodes another emic system es2.
A lower emic system is an emic system es1 that is encoded by another emic system es2.
A higher/lower emic unit is a emic unit of a higher/lower emic system.
The whateveremically encoded item (rare term in most cases) is the linguistic unit(s) encoded by the whatevereme.
^e.g. graphemically encoded item

## things

An e unit (my term) is an emic unit or an etic unit.
»⟮A linguistic unit⟯« is ⟮a generic name⟯ for ⟮an element⟯ which ⟮may form a sequence with others of its kind⟯.
A speech linguistic unit is a linguistic unit produced in speech,
Speech linguistic units are phonemes, phones, syllables, consonants, vowels.
^A linguistic unit may be e.g. phoneme, morpheme, phraseme, grapheme, syllable...
»⟮A segment⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic unit＿⟯ of which ⟮we're not sure which linguistic unit it is⟯, or ⟮for which it is irrelevant⟯.
»⟮A lingueme⟯« is ⟮any whatevereme⟯ which ⟮can be independently learned and transmitted⟯.
»⟮A linguistic item⟯« is ⟮any linguistic thing under analysis⟯.

### whatever

A whatevereme is any possible emic unit.
Whatever is the cake that the relevant emic unit and etic unit share.
A whatevereme is the emic unit of whatever.
A whatevere is the etic unit of whatever.

## feature

»⟮A feature⟯« is a ⟮binary⟯ ⟮value⟯.
Featural is looking at a thing from the perspective of features.

### emic units

⟮＿An emic unit＿⟯ can be ⟮analyzed⟯ ⟮into multiple ＿features＿⟯, instead of ⟮into ＿etic units＿⟯.
»⟮An emic unit⟯« is (under a certain analysis) ⟮an unique combination of⟯ ⟮＿features＿⟯.
»⟮A feature matrix⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿features＿⟯ that ⟮characterize a particular ＿emic unit＿⟯.

### notation

⟮＿A feature＿⟯ is indicated by ⟮[‹name›]⟯.
⟮＿A feature＿⟯'s ⟮states⟯ are indicated by ⟮[+ ‹name›]⟯ and ⟮c_;[- ‹name›]⟯

### grouping

A feature class is a set of features, feature categories or feature classes that are expressing a common thing.
A top-level feature class (my term) is a feature class that is not part of a larger feature class.
A feature category (rare term) is a feature that can take on multiple values.
Alternatively, we can analyze a feature category as a set of features that together give rise to multiple values.
^The difference between a feature class and a feature category is that a emic unit can have multiple features from a feature class, while a feature category is mutually exclusive.

### instances

table:emic unit|analyzable into...
⟮sememe⟯|⟮semantic feature⟯
⟮phoneme⟯|⟮distinctive feature⟯
grammeme|grammatical feature

### polysemy

In a more vague sense, »⟮a feature⟯« may also be ⟮any linguistically salient property⟯ of ⟮a languoid⟯.

## sequences

»⟮A string⟯« is most commonly assumed to be ⟮a string of words⟯, but may also be a synonym for ⟮sequence of any linguistic unit⟯.
»⟮A sequence of linguistic units⟯« is ⟮a series of these linguistic units⟯ with ⟮no claim as to compositionality⟯.

## combination

The »⟮principle of compositionality⟯« is that ⟮the meaning⟯ of ⟮an expression⟯ can ⟮be determined by⟯ ⟮c_-2;the meaning⟯ of ⟮its constituent parts⟯ and ⟮rules to combine them⟯.

# what is language?

## language

»⟮A language⟯« is a ⟮specific kind⟯ of ⟮structured⟯ ⟮communication system⟯.
»⟮Language⟯« (⟮ability⟯) is the ability to ⟮use (a) language(s) to communicate⟯.

## language modality

»⟮language modality⟯« is by what ⟮＿language (occurence)＿⟯ is ⟮produced⟯ and ⟮c_;percieved⟯.
There are three common ⟮＿language modalities＿⟯: ⟮＿oral-auditory＿⟯, ⟮＿visual-gestural＿⟯, ⟮＿manual-visual＿⟯ (my term).
»⟮Speech⟯« is  ⟮＿language produced/production＿⟯ with the ⟮＿oral-auditory＿⟯ ⟮＿language modality＿⟯.

»⟮A sign/spoken/written language⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮designed to be⟯ ⟮produced via ＿sign/speech/writing＿⟯. 
⟮＿Sign＿ ＆ ＿speech＿⟯ consist(s) of ⟮phones⟯ and ⟮c_;phonemes⟯.
⟮＿Writing＿⟯ consist(s) of ⟮glyphs⟯ and ⟮c_;graphemes⟯.

## language porduction.

»⟮Language production⟯« is ⟮the process⟯ of ⟮c_;production⟯ of ⟮＿language (occurence)＿⟯.
