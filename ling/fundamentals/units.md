# units

E refers to an abstract sign universe whole.
A whatever is a given e.
An e unit refers to an abstract sign universe component.
A whatever unit is a given e unit.
The whatevername is the name we give to a whatever.

## emic 

Emic refers to e's sign whole.
The emic topic is e's sign topic.
An emic cake is the sign cake of a given emic topic.
An emic inventory is a sign component set of a given emic cake.
An emic unit is a sign component from a given emic inventory.
Sometimes, it very much feels like emic (and related concepts) all only refer to the signifier.

### naming

A whatevereme is the emic unit of a whatever.
Something whateveremic is the something of a whatevereme.
For a given whatever, something whateveremic is called whatevername+emic
For a given whatever, whatevereme always has the name whatevername+me

### other levels

An emic unit may signify a higher emic unit or 'meaning'.
An emic unit may be signified by a lower emic unit or a physical medium.
A higher/lower emic cake is the emic cake whose signifer/signified is the current emic cake.
A higher/lower emic unit(s) is an emic unit of a higher/lower emic cake.
The emically signified item (rare term in most cases) is the signified of the emic unit.
For a given whatever, an emically signified item is called whatevername+emically signified item.

## systems

An emic system is the combination of an emic inventory and an emic rule set.
An emic rule set is the set of rules governing the emic inventory in the languoid.
For a given whatever, an emic system/rule set is called a whatevername+emic system/rule set.

### emictactics

emictactics (lol) is the part of an emic rule set dealing with emictactic constraints.
A emictactic constraint is a rule for the permissible combination of emic units.
For a given whatever, an emictactic constraint is called a whatevername+tactic constraint
^e.g. phonotactic constraint

## analyses

Emic units can be analyzed into either etic units or features.
While emic units vary based on the languoid, etic units and features are cross-linguistic elements.

### etic

An etic unit is a division of an emic unit's signifier component into a number of variant forms.
From the perspective of the etic unit, an emic unit is in fact an abstract unit of a number of variant forms.
A whatevere is the etic unit of whatever.
For a given whatever, a etic unit is called a whatevername+(ø or e)

#### alternants

»⟮An alternant⟯« is a ⟮different⟯ ⟮＿etic unit＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same emic unit＿⟯.
^However, alternant is often only used for allomorphs
»⟮Alternation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ ⟮c_-;existing⟯.
»⟮An alloetic unit⟯« is an alternant of the same etic unit.
For a given etic unit, an alloetic unit is called allo + etic unit name.

#### distribution

»⟮The etic environment⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮before and after the target ＿etic unit＿⟯.
⟮＿free variation＿⟯ and ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯ are the states ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ can be in if ⟮they appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯ is the state ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ must be in if ⟮they don't appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
»⟮Free variation⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮do not have ＿emic contrast＿⟯.
»⟮Contrastive distribution⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮have ＿emic contrast＿⟯
In ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, ⟮changing between two ＿etic units＿⟯ is ⟮impossible (since they never appear in the same etic environment)⟯ and thus ⟮the idea of ＿emic contrast＿ does not apply⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯, they ⟮are ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯, they ⟮are not ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, they ⟮may or may not be ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
Ergo ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮without ＿emic contrast＿⟯ may still ⟮be part of different ＿emic units＿⟯ if they are ⟮very dissibilar etically⟯.

»⟮Emic contrast⟯« is when ⟮changing one ＿etic unit＿ for another⟯ alters ⟮the resulting ＿emic unit＿⟯.
⟮contrastive⟯ = ⟮emic⟯
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ are »⟮emic/contrastive⟯« if they are ⟮in ＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
»⟮A minimal pair⟯« is ⟮two or more ＿lexical units＿⟯ that are ⟮the same⟯ ⟮except for one positio⟯n, which is in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
Finding ⟮a ＿minimal pair＿⟯ ⟮proves⟯ that ⟮the two ＿etic units＿ involved⟯ are ⟮part of different ＿emic units＿⟯.
⟮＿Emic contrast＿⟯ has been »⟮neutralized⟯« when ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ appear i⟮n an ＿etic environment＿⟯ in which ⟮they are no longer ＿contrastive＿⟯.
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯ may still be ⟮＿variants＿ of a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

### features


»⟮A feature⟯« is a ⟮binary⟯ ⟮value⟯.
Featural is looking at a thing from the perspective of features.

#### emic units

⟮＿An emic unit＿⟯ can be ⟮analyzed⟯ ⟮into multiple ＿features＿⟯, instead of ⟮into ＿etic units＿⟯.
»⟮An emic unit⟯« is (under a certain analysis) ⟮an unique combination of⟯ ⟮＿features＿⟯.
»⟮A feature matrix⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿features＿⟯ that ⟮characterize a particular ＿emic unit＿⟯.

#### notation

⟮＿A feature＿⟯ is indicated by ⟮[‹name›]⟯.
⟮＿A feature＿⟯'s ⟮states⟯ are indicated by ⟮[+ ‹name›]⟯ and ⟮c_;[- ‹name›]⟯

#### grouping

A feature class is a set of features, feature categories or feature classes that are expressing a common thing.
A top-level feature class (my term) is a feature class that is not part of a larger feature class.
A feature category (rare term) is a feature that can take on multiple values.
Alternatively, we can analyze a feature category as a set of features that together give rise to multiple values.
^The difference between a feature class and a feature category is that a emic unit can have multiple features from a feature class, while a feature category is mutually exclusive.

##### seemingly sui generis

»⟮A semantic class⟯« contains ⟮＿all lexical units＿⟯ that ⟮share a ＿semantic feature＿⟯.

### polysemy

In a more vague sense, »⟮a feature⟯« may also be ⟮any linguistically salient property⟯ of ⟮a languoid⟯.

## study & interrelation

emics/etics is the study of e in terms of emic/etic units.
For a given whatever, emics/etics is called whatevername+emics/etics
^e.g. graphemics, phonetics
es is the study of e.
Ergo, es is the conver term of emics and etics.
For a given whatever, es is called whatevername+s.
emic emics is the study of the relation between an emic unit and its signifier emic unit.
For a given whatever, whatever2, emic emics is called whatevername+emic whatevername2+emics.
^e.g. lexemic sememics (more commonly: lexical semantics)

## exprs

Importantly, etic units are still in some sense abstract, they are not exprs.
An expr is an instance of production of something from the emic unit's signifier topic/cake.
Alternatively, an expr is one of the infinite set of things that are grouped into an etic unit.
^e.g. saying a sound, writing a glyph....

## related things

»⟮A linguistic item⟯« is ⟮any linguistic thing under analysis⟯.
»⟮A linguistic unit⟯« is a linguistic item which may form a sequence with others of its kind.
A linguistic unit sequence is a series of the same kind of linguistic unit with no claim as to compositionality.

A recieving language modality is by which medium a blah is recieved.
The three producing language modalities are oral, gestural and manual.
The two recieving language modalities are auditory and visual.

### producing + recieving

Speech is the language modality with producing: oral and recieving: auditory.
Sign is the language modality with producing: gestural and recieving: visual.
Writing is the language modality with producing: manual and recieving: visual.
