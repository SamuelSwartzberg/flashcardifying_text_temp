## naming

List of levels: phon, graph, lex/lex unit, phras, morph, sem/semant, pract, kin, gram/grammat, ling

### irregular

the etic unit of graphics is more commonly glyph than graph
the emic unit of practics is a pragmeme rather than a practeme
the \$LEVELNAME is more rarely semant rather than sem
the \$LEVELNAME is more rarely grammat rather than gram

### name details & polysemy

Often, the morpheme {gram} is actually used as a synonym for {graph} instead of for grammeme-related things.
Things related to lexemes are more commonly called lexical whatever.
lexical item =syn=lexical unit.

### meaning details

#### lex

»⟮A lexeme⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme unit＿⟯ that ⟮is a single word⟯.
Most commonly, ⟮the distinction between⟯ ⟮＿lexeme＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿lexical unit＿⟯ is ⟮not at issue⟯.

#### pract

A pragmatic act is what one does when saying something.
As different from our usual definitions, »⟮a pract⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮a certain utterance⟯ and ⟮a context⟯ that ⟮give rise to a certain ＿pragmatic act＿.⟯
As different from our usual definitions, »⟮allopracts⟯« are ⟮＿all practs＿⟯ that ⟮result in the same ＿pragmatic act＿.⟯

#### other

A phraseme has the additional constraint that it violates the principle of compositionality to a certain degree.
A morphophoneme can basically be seen to fuse phoneme and morpheme, directly signifying meaning via phones as alternants.

## details

### lex

The lexemic unit inventory is more commonly called the lexis.
The lexis may also be a subset of a lexemic unit inventory grouped by some criterion.

### graph

The graphemic system is more commonly called a writing system.
writing system =syn= script
The graphemic rule set is more commonly called an orthography.
Graphemic depth is more commonly called orthographic depth.
»A phonemic orthography« is the special case of ⟮＿an alphabet＿ specifically⟯ ⟮having no or little orthographic depth⟯.

### phon

Suprasegmental phonology is also called prosody.
suprasegmental phonic feature is also called prosodic feature.
⟮prosody⟯ is also sometimes used in a⟮ more narrow⟯ sense as a synonym to ⟮metre in poetry⟯.
A phonic suprasegmental unit is more commonly called prosodic unit.

### study

Semantics is the study of semics and related phenomena.
Lexicology is the study of lexics and related phenomena.

### other

Lemma is the only emma for which the term actually already exists.
