# emic rule set

»⟮An emic rule set⟯« is ⟮the set of rules⟯ governing ⟮＿the emic inventory＿⟯ in ＿the languoid＿.

## cross-segmental

Something »⟮cross-segmental⟯« ⟮concerns multiple ＿e?ic units＿⟯.

### etactic constraints

»⟮etactics⟯« (lol) is ⟮the part of⟯ a ⟮＿emic rule set＿⟯ dealing with ⟮＿etactic constraints＿⟯.
»⟮A etactic constraint⟯« is ⟮a rule for⟯ the ⟮permissible⟯ ⟮＿cross-segmental＿⟯ ⟮c_-;combination⟯ of ⟮＿e?ic units＿⟯.
^e.g. phonotactic constraint

### sequences

»⟮A sequence⎵ling units⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a sequence＿ of⟯ ⟮the same kind of ＿e?ic unit＿⟯ with ⟮no claim as to compositionality⟯.
»⟮A string⟯« is ⟮a ＿sm＿ ＿sequence＿⟯, most commonly of ⟮＿words＿⟯.

### environment

»⟮The e?ic environment⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿e?ic units＿⟯ ⟮before and after ＿an e?ic unit＿⟯.
»⟮e?ic conditioning⟯« is ⟮the influincing⟯ of ⟮＿alternant selection＿⟯ by ⟮＿the e?ic environment＿⟯.

### linearity

»⟮Linearity⟯« is the presumtion that ⟮＿e?ic units＿⟯ ⟮occur sequentially⟯ with ⟮1-to-1 emic-etic correspondence⟯.
⟮＿Linearity＿⟯ is ⟮probably untenable⟯ for ⟮most⟯ e?ic units in ⟮c_;most⟯ cases.

## emic deviation

»⟮Emic deviation⟯« (my term) is ⟮the regular divergence⟯ of ⟮＿emic correspondence＿⟯ in ⟮a certain context⟯ as ⟮prescribed by ＿the emic rule set＿⟯.
^e.g. lexemic deviation: deviation between a word its the usual meaning
»⟮Emic depth⟯« (my termish) is ⟮the degree of⟯ ⟮＿emic deviation＿⟯ for ⟮a given ＿emic system＿⟯.
