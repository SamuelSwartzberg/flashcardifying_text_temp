# emic whole

## structuralism

»⟮An emic whole⟯« is ⟮＿the sign universe＿⟯ for the relevant ⟮＿level topic＿⟯.
»⟮The emic cake/divider/component/component set⟯« is ⟮the selfsame⟯ of ⟮＿the emic whole＿⟯.
Sometimes, it very much feels like emic (and related concepts) all only refer to the signifier.
»⟮eology⟯« =syn= ⟮＿emics＿⟯

### other levels

⟮＿An emic unit＿⟯ may ⟮signify⟯ ⟮another ＿emic unit＿⟯ or ⟮c_;'meaning'⟯.
⟮＿An emic unit＿⟯ may ⟮be signified by⟯ ⟮another ＿emic unit＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a language modality＿⟯.
»⟮A higher/lower emic cake⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the emic cake＿⟯ ⟮reachable by traversing⟯ ⟮signifiers/signifieds⟯.
»⟮A higher/lower emic unit(s)⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯ of ⟮＿a higher/lower emic cake＿⟯.
»⟮The emically signified item⟯« (rare term in most cases) is ⟮＿the signified＿⟯ of ⟮＿the emic unit＿⟯.
»⟮emic emics⟯« is the study of ⟮the relation between⟯ ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯ and ⟮its ＿signifier＿ ＿emic unit＿⟯.
^e.g. lexemic sememics (more commonly: lexical semantics)

## emic units

»⟮An e?ic unit boundary⟯« is ⟮the spot between two⟯ ⟮＿e?ic units＿⟯.
»⟮The e?ic inventory⟯« is ⟮＿the component set＿⟯ of ⟮＿the e?ic whole＿⟯. 
»⟮Emic correspondence⟯« (my term) is ⟮the correspondence between⟯ ⟮＿the signifier＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿signified＿⟯ of ⟮c-;＿an emic unit＿⟯.

## analyses

⟮＿Emic units＿⟯ can be analyzed via ⟮＿the etic analysis＿⟯ or ⟮＿the featural analysis＿⟯.
Etic units can also be analyzed into featues.
»⟮A emic/etic feature⟯« is ⟮＿a feature＿⟯ characterizing ⟮＿an emic/etic unit＿⟯.

### subemic elements

»⟮A subemic element⟯« is ⟮＿a cross-linguistic element＿⟯ of which ⟮some combination⟯ ⟮gives rise to ＿an emic unit＿⟯.
The main ⟮＿subemic elements＿⟯ are ⟮＿etic units＿⟯ and ⟮＿features＿⟯.

### contrastiveness

Something being »⟮contrastive⟯« means that ⟮changing it⟯ ⟮would produce a different ＿emic unit＿⟯.
⟮＿A contrast＿⟯ being »⟮neutralized⟯« is appearing ⟮in ＿an etic environment＿⟯ as ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ where ⟮they normally would be⟯ ⟮c_-4;contrastive⟯

### etic

»⟮The etic analysis⟯« (my term) is seeing ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯ as ⟮an abstract form⟯ of ⟮n ＿etic units＿⟯.
»⟮An etic unit⟯« is ⟮a division⟯ of ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯'s ⟮＿signifier component＿⟯ into ⟮a number of ＿alternants＿⟯.
»⟮An emma⟯« is ⟮＿an etic unit＿⟯ ⟮chosen arbitrarily⟯ to ⟮represent ＿the emic unit＿⟯.
TODO: emic-etic correspondence

#### alternants

»⟮An alternant⟯« is a ⟮different⟯ ⟮＿etic unit＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same emic unit＿⟯.
»⟮Alternation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ ⟮c_-;existing⟯.
»⟮An alloetic unit⟯« is ⟮＿an alternant＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same etic unit＿⟯.
»⟮Alternant selection⟯« is ⟮choosing ＿an alternant＿⟯ ⟮for ＿an emic unit＿⟯.

#### distribution

»⟮The etic relationship⟯« (my term) is ⟮the relationship⟯ ⟮two ＿etic units＿ can have⟯ related to ⟮their ＿emic contrast＿ and ＿etic environemnt＿⟯.
»⟮The three etic relationships⟯« are ⟮＿free variation＿⟯, ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯, and ⟮＿complimentary distribution＿⟯.

##### mapping

table:etic relationship|etic environment|contrast|alloetic units
»⟮free variation⟯«|⟮same⟯|⟮no⟯|⟮yes⟯
»⟮contrastive distribution⟯«|⟮same⟯|⟮yes⟯|⟮no⟯
»⟮complimentary distribution⟯«|⟮different⟯|⟮not the same etic environment, thus impossible⟯|⟮if similar etically/featurally⟯


Ergo ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮without ＿emic contrast＿⟯ may still ⟮be part of different ＿emic units＿⟯ if they are ⟮very dissibilar etically⟯.

##### minimal pair

»⟮A minimal pair⟯« is ⟮two or more ＿lexemic units＿⟯ that are ⟮the same⟯ ⟮except for one ＿segment＿⟯, which is in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
Finding ⟮a ＿minimal pair＿⟯ ⟮proves⟯ that ⟮the two ＿etic units＿ involved⟯ are ⟮part of different ＿emic units＿⟯.
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯ may still be ⟮＿variants＿ of a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

#### surface and underlying

»⟮The surface representation/form⟯« is ⟮＿the etic unit＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿segment＿⟯.
»⟮The underlying representation/form⟯« is ⟮＿the emic unit＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿segment＿⟯.
»⟮Realization⟯« is ⟮the relationship between⟯ ⟮＿surface form＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿underlying form＿⟯.

### features

»⟮The featural analysis⟯« (repurposed term) seeing ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯ as ⟮a combination of ＿features＿⟯.
»⟮A feature⟯« is either ⟮＿a ffeature＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a fcategory＿⟯.
»⟮Featural⟯« is ⟮looking at a thing⟯ from ⟮the perspective of ＿features＿⟯.
»⟮A feature matrix⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿features＿⟯ that ⟮characterize a particular ＿e?ic unit＿⟯.

#### types

»⟮A ffeature⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a feature＿⟯ that takes ⟮a binary value⟯.
»⟮A fcategory⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a feature＿⟯ that takes ⟮multiple ＿fvalues＿⟯.
»⟮A fvalue⟯« is ⟮a value of ＿a feature＿⟯.

##### distinctive feature

»⟮A distinctive/non-distinctive feature⟯« is ⟮＿a distinctive/non-distinctive feature⎵local⎵＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a distinctive/non-distinctive feature⎵universal⎵＿⟯.
»⟮A distinctive/non-distinctive feature⎵local⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a feature＿⟯ that is ⟮＿contrastive/not contrastive＿⟯ in the given language.
»⟮A distinctive/non-distinctive feature⎵universal⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a feature＿⟯ that is ⟮＿contrastive/not contrastive＿⟯ in ⟮some/any language(s)⟯.

##### grouping emic units

»⟮A natural class⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿emic units＿⟯ in a language that ⟮share one or more ＿sm distinctive features＿⟯, thus ⟮behaving similarly in certain situations⟯.
»⟮A semantic class⟯« contains ⟮＿all lexemic units＿⟯ that ⟮share a ＿semic feature＿⟯.

#### notation

⟮＿A feature＿⟯ is indicated by ⟮[‹name›]⟯.
⟮＿A feature＿⟯'s ⟮states⟯ are indicated by ⟮[+ ‹name›]⟯ and ⟮c_;[- ‹name›]⟯

#### grouping features

»⟮A fclass⟯« is ⟮a set of⟯ ⟮＿features＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿feature categories＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿fclasses＿⟯ that ⟮are expressing a common thing⟯.
»⟮A top-level fclass⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a fclass＿⟯ that is ⟮not part of a larger ＿fclass＿⟯.
^The difference between a fclass and a fcategory is that a emic unit can have multiple features from a fclass, while a fcategory is mutually exclusive.

#### polysemy

»⟮a feature⎵alternative context⎵⟯« may also be ⟮any linguistically salient property⟯ of ⟮a languoid⟯.

## exprs

Importantly, ⟮＿etic units＿⟯ are still in some sense ⟮abstract⟯, they are not ⟮c_-;＿exprs＿⟯.
»⟮An expr⟯« is ⟮an instance of production⟯ of ⟮something from the ＿emic unit＿'s ＿signifier topic/cake＿⟯.
Alternatively, »⟮an expr⟯« is ⟮one of the infinite set of things⟯ that ⟮are grouped into ＿an etic unit＿⟯.
^e.g. saying a sound, writing a glyph....

## derived units

»⟮A ling/lingueme⟯« is ⟮＿an etic/emic unit＿⟯ that ⟮can be individually taught/transmitted⟯.
⟮s*m⟯ ⟮{\$LEVELNAME+emo}⟯⟮\$LEVELNAME+eme⟯ = ⟮s*m emic unit 1 ∨ s*m emic unit 2 ∨⟯ ...
⟮s*m⟯ ⟮{\$LEVELNAME+o}⟯⟮\$LEVELNAME+e⟯ = ⟮s*m etic unit 1 ∨ s*m etic unit 2 ∨⟯ ...
^and so on





»⟮Reduplication⟯« is ⟮the repetition of⟯ ⟮one or more ＿segments＿⟯ within a larger unit to ⟮produce some effect⟯.
