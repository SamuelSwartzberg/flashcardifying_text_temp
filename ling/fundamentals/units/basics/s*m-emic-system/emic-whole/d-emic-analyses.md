# analyses

⟮＿Emic units＿⟯ can be analyzed via ⟮＿the etic analysis＿⟯ or ⟮＿the featural analysis＿⟯.

## subemic elements

»⟮A subemic element⟯« is ⟮＿a cross-linguistic element＿⟯ of which ⟮some combination⟯ ⟮gives rise to the abstract concept of an ＿an emic unit＿⟯.
The main ⟮＿subemic elements＿⟯ are ⟮＿etic units＿⟯ and ⟮＿features＿⟯.

## contrastiveness

Something being »⟮contrastive⟯« means that ⟮changing it⟯ ⟮would produce a different ＿emic unit＿⟯.
⟮＿A contrast＿⟯ being »⟮neutralized⟯« is appearing ⟮in ＿an etic environment＿⟯ as ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ where ⟮they normally would be⟯ ⟮c_-4;contrastive⟯

## etic

»⟮The etic analysis⟯« (my term) is seeing »⟮an emic unit⟯« as ⟮an abstract form⟯ of ⟮n ＿etic units＿⟯.
»⟮An etic unit⟯« is ⟮a division⟯ of ⟮＿an emic unit＿⟯'s ⟮＿signifier component＿⟯ into ⟮a number of ＿alternants＿⟯.
»⟮An emma⟯« is ⟮＿an etic unit＿⟯ ⟮chosen arbitrarily⟯ to ⟮represent ＿the emic unit＿⟯.

### alternants

»⟮An alternant⟯« is a ⟮different⟯ ⟮＿etic unit＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same emic unit＿⟯.
»⟮Alternation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ ⟮c_-;existing⟯.
»⟮An alloetic unit⟯« is ⟮＿an alternant＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same etic unit＿⟯.
»⟮Alternant selection⟯« is ⟮choosing ＿an alternant＿⟯ ⟮for ＿an emic unit＿⟯.

### etic relationship

#### definition

»⟮The etic relationship⟯« (my term) is ⟮the relationship⟯ ⟮two ＿etic units＿ can have⟯ related to ⟮their ＿emic contrast＿ and ＿etic environemnt＿⟯.

#### division

»⟮The three etic relationships⟯« are ⟮＿free variation＿⟯, ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯, and ⟮＿complimentary distribution＿⟯.

#### mapping

table:etic relationship|etic environment|contrast|alloetic units
»⟮free variation⟯«|⟮same⟯|⟮no⟯|⟮yes⟯
»⟮contrastive distribution⟯«|⟮same⟯|⟮yes⟯|⟮no⟯
»⟮complimentary distribution⟯«|⟮different⟯|⟮not the same etic environment, thus impossible⟯|⟮if similar etically/featurally⟯


Ergo ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮without ＿emic contrast＿⟯ may still ⟮be part of different ＿emic units＿⟯ if they are ⟮very dissibilar etically⟯.

#### minimal pair

»⟮A minimal pair⟯« is ⟮two or more ＿lexemic units＿⟯ that are ⟮the same⟯ ⟮except for one ＿segment＿⟯, which is in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
Finding ⟮a ＿minimal pair＿⟯ ⟮proves⟯ that ⟮the two ＿etic units＿ involved⟯ are ⟮part of different ＿emic units＿⟯.
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯ may still be ⟮＿variants＿ of a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

### surface and underlying

»⟮The surface/underlying representation/form⟯« is ⟮＿the etic/emic unit＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿segment＿⟯.
»⟮Realization⟯« is ⟮the relationship between⟯ ⟮＿surface form＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿underlying form＿⟯.

### emic-etic correspondence

»⟮Emic-etic correspondence/deviation⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the underlying representation＿⟯ ⟮being/not being⟯ ⟮＿an etic unit＿⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the surface representation.＿⟯
^in theory, this should always be the case, but it isn't

## features

»⟮The featural analysis⟯« (repurposed term) is seeing »⟮an emic unit⟯« as ⟮a combination of ＿features＿⟯.
