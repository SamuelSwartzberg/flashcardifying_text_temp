# change of e?ic units

## basics

A change of e?ic units is the change of (an) e?ic unit(s) in a string for any reason.

## reason

### diachronic/synchronic

»⟮Diachronic/synchronic change of e?ic units⟯« is ⟮＿change of e?ic units＿⟯ ⟮for ＿diachronic＿/＿synchronic＿ reasons/functions⟯.

### synchronic

Synchronic change of e?ic units may be alternant selection or contrastive.
Mutation⎵wide⎵ is a change of e?ic units which is e?ic conditioning (which itself is alternant selection, thus synchronic).
\$LEVELNAME mutation is the mutation of \$LEVELNAME e?ic units.
\$LEVELNAME \$LEVELNAME mutation is mutation where the reason for the change was the \$LEVELNAME environment

### diachronic

transeologization (e.g. transphonologization) is the diachronic change of e?ic units such that the contrast is preserved but the feature it is based on changes.

## types
