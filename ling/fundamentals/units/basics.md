# basics

»⟮A linguistic item⟯« is ⟮any linguistic thing under analysis⟯.

## foundation

A level is a rough grouping 
The level topic is the the general topic of the level.
The level name is the name to scope something to that particular level.
\$LEVELNAME is a given level name.
The study of a level is called \$LEVELNAMEs.
A level consists of a segmental emic system, a suprasegmental emic system and the segmental-suprasegmental interface.
S*egmental refers to either segmental or suprasegmental.
The segmental emic system deals with smaller units than the suprasegmental emic system.
s*egmental unit = s*egmental e?ic unit
e?ic unit should be short for s*egmental e?ic unit, but in practice often merely refers to a segmental e?ic unit

## either seg/supraseg

A s*egmental emic system consists of the emic whole and the emic rule set.
Conditioning is the combination of the segmental e?ic conditioning and suprasegmental conditioning.

### e?ic

e?ic is purposefully ambiguous between emic and etic.
E?ic unit =syn= e?ic component.
The e?ic inventory is the set of e?ic units.
An e?ic unit boundary is the spot between two e/mic/etic units.
e?ics is the study of e?ic units.
An e?ic inventory is the component set of the e?ic whole.
linguistic unit =syn= e?ic unit

#### linearity

Linearity is the presumtion that e?ic units occur sequentially with 1-to-1 emic-etic correspondence.
Linearity is probably untenable for most e?ic units in most cases.

#### environment

The e?ic environment is the set of e?ic units before and after an e?ic unit.
e?ic conditioning is the influincing of alternant selection by the e?ic environment.

### emic

An emic whole is the sign universe for the relevant level topic.
The emic cake/divider/component/component set is the selfsame of the emic whole.
An emic rule set is the set of rules governing the emic inventory in the languoid.
Sometimes, it very much feels like emic (and related concepts) all only refer to the signifier.
emics is more frequently called eology.

#### emic correspondence

Emic correspondence (my term) is the correspondence between the signifier and signified of an emic unit.
Emic deviation (my term) is the regular divergence of emic correspondence in a certain context as prescribed by the emic rule set.
^e.g. lexemic deviation: deviation between a word its the usual meaning
Emic depth (my termish) is the degree of emic deviation.

#### other levels

An emic unit may signify another emic unit or 'meaning'.
An emic unit may be signified by another emic unit or a physical medium.
A higher/lower emic cake is the emic cake reachable by traversing signifiers/signifieds.
A higher/lower emic unit(s) is an emic unit of a higher/lower emic cake.
The emically signified item (rare term in most cases) is the signified of the emic unit.
emic emics is the study of the relation between an emic unit and its signifier emic unit.
^e.g. lexemic sememics (more commonly: lexical semantics)

### naming

emic/etic unit for a given level: ((supra)segmental) \$LEVELNAME+(eme/e)
being related to emic/etic units for a given level: ((supra)segmental) \$LEVELNAME+(emic/etic)

### emic analyses

Emic units can be analyzed into either etic units or features.
While emic units vary based on the languoid, etic units and features are cross-linguistic elements.

#### etic

An etic unit is a division of an emic unit's signifier component into a number of alternants.
From the perspective of the etic unit, an emic unit is in fact an abstract unit of a number of alternants.
A whatevere is the etic unit of whatever.
For a given whatever, a etic unit is called a whatevername+(ø or e)
An emma is an etic unit chosen arbitrarily to represent the emic unit.
For a given whatever, an emma is called a whatevername-final consonant if extant+mmma.

##### alternants

»⟮An alternant⟯« is a ⟮different⟯ ⟮＿etic unit＿⟯ ⟮of ＿the same emic unit＿⟯.
^However, alternant is often only used for allomorphs
»⟮Alternation⟯« is ⟮the fact of⟯ ⟮＿alternants＿⟯ ⟮c_-;existing⟯.
»⟮An alloetic unit⟯« is an alternant of the same etic unit.
Alternant selection is choosing an alternant for an emic unit.
For a given etic unit, an alloetic unit is called allo + etic unit name.

##### distribution

»⟮The etic environment⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮before and after the target ＿etic unit＿⟯.
⟮＿free variation＿⟯ and ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯ are the states ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ can be in if ⟮they appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯ is the state ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ must be in if ⟮they don't appear in the same ＿etic environment＿⟯.
»⟮Free variation⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮do not have ＿emic contrast＿⟯.
»⟮Contrastive distribution⟯« is the state in which ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮have ＿emic contrast＿⟯
In ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, ⟮changing between two ＿etic units＿⟯ is ⟮impossible (since they never appear in the same etic environment)⟯ and thus ⟮the idea of ＿emic contrast＿ does not apply⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯, they ⟮are ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯, they ⟮are not ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
If ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ are in ⟮＿complementary distribution＿⟯, they ⟮may or may not be ＿alternants＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿emic unit＿⟯.
Ergo ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ ⟮without ＿emic contrast＿⟯ may still ⟮be part of different ＿emic units＿⟯ if they are ⟮very dissibilar etically⟯.

»⟮Emic contrast⟯« is when ⟮changing one ＿etic unit＿ for another⟯ alters ⟮the resulting ＿emic unit＿⟯.
⟮contrastive⟯ = ⟮emic⟯
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ are »⟮emic/contrastive⟯« if they are ⟮in ＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
»⟮A minimal pair⟯« is ⟮two or more ＿lexical units＿⟯ that are ⟮the same⟯ ⟮except for one positio⟯n, which is in ⟮＿contrastive distribution＿⟯.
Finding ⟮a ＿minimal pair＿⟯ ⟮proves⟯ that ⟮the two ＿etic units＿ involved⟯ are ⟮part of different ＿emic units＿⟯.
⟮＿Emic contrast＿⟯ has been »⟮neutralized⟯« when ⟮two ＿etic units＿⟯ appear i⟮n an ＿etic environment＿⟯ in which ⟮they are no longer ＿contrastive＿⟯.
⟮Two ＿etic units＿⟯ in ⟮＿free variation＿⟯ may still be ⟮＿variants＿ of a ＿sociolinguistic variable＿⟯.

##### surface and underlying

The surface representation/form is the etic unit of a given segment.
The underlying representation/form is the emic unit of a given segment.
Realization is the relationship between surface form and underlying form.

#### features


»⟮A feature⟯« is a ⟮binary⟯ ⟮value⟯.
A distinctive feature is a feature that is contrastive in the given language or at least in some languages.
A non-distinctive feature is a feature that is not contrastive in a given language or ever.
Featural is looking at a thing from the perspective of features.
For a given whatever, an ø/emic/etic feature is called a whatevername+ø/emic/etic feature.

##### emic units

⟮＿An emic unit＿⟯ can be ⟮analyzed⟯ ⟮into multiple ＿features＿⟯, instead of ⟮into ＿etic units＿⟯.
»⟮An emic unit⟯« is (under a certain analysis) ⟮an unique combination of⟯ ⟮＿features＿⟯.
»⟮A feature matrix⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿features＿⟯ that ⟮characterize a particular ＿emic unit＿⟯.

##### notation

⟮＿A feature＿⟯ is indicated by ⟮[‹name›]⟯.
⟮＿A feature＿⟯'s ⟮states⟯ are indicated by ⟮[+ ‹name›]⟯ and ⟮c_;[- ‹name›]⟯

##### grouping

A feature class is a set of features, feature categories or feature classes that are expressing a common thing.
A top-level feature class (my term) is a feature class that is not part of a larger feature class.
A feature category (rare term) is a feature that can take on multiple values.
A feature value is a value of a feature category.
Alternatively, we can analyze a feature category as a set of features that together give rise to multiple values.
^The difference between a feature class and a feature category is that a emic unit can have multiple features from a feature class, while a feature category is mutually exclusive.

###### seemingly sui generis

»⟮A semantic class⟯« contains ⟮＿all lexical units＿⟯ that ⟮share a ＿semic feature＿⟯.

#### polysemy

In a more vague sense, »⟮a feature⟯« may also be ⟮any linguistically salient property⟯ of ⟮a languoid⟯.

### exprs

Importantly, etic units are still in some sense abstract, they are not exprs.
An expr is an instance of production of something from the emic unit's signifier topic/cake.
Alternatively, an expr is one of the infinite set of things that are grouped into an etic unit.
^e.g. saying a sound, writing a glyph....

### sequences

A linguistic unit sequence is a series of the same kind of linguistic unit with no claim as to compositionality.
A speech linguistic unit is a linguistic unit produced in speech.
Speech linguistic units are phonemes, phones, syllables, consonants, vowels.
»⟮A string⟯« is a linguistic unit sequence, most commonly of words.

### derived units

A ling/lingueme is an etic/emic unit that can be individually taught/transmitted.
s*egmental {\$LEVELNAME+emo}\$LEVELNAME+eme = s*egmental emic unit 1 ∨ segmental emic unit 2 ∨ ...
s*egmental {\$LEVELNAME+o}\$LEVELNAME+e = s*egmental etic unit 1 ∨ segmental etic unit 2 ∨ ...
^and so on

## segmental

Segment = segmental e?ic unit

### cross-segmental

Something cross-segmental concerns multiple segments, but isn't a suprasegmental.
emictactics (lol) is the part of an emic rule set dealing with emictactic constraints.
A emictactic constraint is a rule for the permissible combination of emic units.
For a given whatever, an emictactic constraint is called a whatevername+tactic constraint
^e.g. phonotactic constraint

## suprasegmental

Sometimes, suprasegmentals are not analyzed as their own emic system, but only as features passed down.
The suprasegmental motivator is the higher emic unit that motivates the a suprasegmental.
pausa =syn= suprasegmental e?ic unit boundary.

### juncture

A juncture is a segmental emic unit posited that does the job of suprasegmentals but is part of the sequental flow of emic units.
A chunk is the segments between a juncture.

## combination

The suprasegmental environment is the set of suprasegmentals and pausas that apply to a given segmental e?ic unit.
Segmental conditioning is the influencing of segmental emic unit alternant selection by the suprasegmental environment.

### suprasegmentals

Suprasegmentals may be analyzed as their own suprasegmental e/emic/etic units or as suprasegmental features.
A suprasegmental unit is a suprasegmental of which we don't want to say whether it's emic or etic.
Suprasegmental features (if we use them) are additional features 'added to' those already making up the e/emic/etic unit.
A pausa is the conceptual start/end of a suprasegmental unit.
