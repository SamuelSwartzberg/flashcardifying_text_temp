### langue and parole

flex-container:✫round-sign-structuralism.jpg✫✫planes-sound-thought.png✫


As regards languoids, ⟮De Sassure⟯ created the distinction between ⟮langue⟯ and ⟮c_;parole⟯. 
⟮＿langue and parole＿⟯ are about ⟮what we're talking about when⟯ we ⟮say language (or, well, languoid)⟯
»⟮Langue⟯« is ⟮the structuralist system⟯ of a given languoid 
»⟮Parole⟯« is ⟮all instances of the use⟯ of a languoid

!Sassure claims that in the ⟮langue⟯ of ⟮spoken language⟯
- !the ⟮＿signified＿⟯ is ⟮the concept⟯
- !the ⟮＿signifier＿⟯ is ⟮(the psychological reality of) the phonological realization⟯. 

### synchronic/diachronic

As regards viewpoints, ⟮De Sassure⟯ created the distinction between ⟮＿synchronic and diachronic＿⟯.
⟮＿Synchronic and diachronic＿⟯ are two perspectives we can take on related to ⟮how we care about⟯ ⟮the history of a language⟯ in ⟮c-;our analysis⟯.
A »⟮synchronic⟯« viewpoint considers a languoid⟮ at a moment in time without taking its history into account⟯.
A »⟮diachronic⟯« approach considers a languoid⟮'s history⟯.
If we're being structuralist, a synchronic approach specifically consideres the structuralist system of a languoid.

## ways things can exist

### markedness

According to ⟮Haspelmath (2005)⟯, ⟮markedness⟯ has ⟮12 distinctive senses⟯, which makes it ⟮pretty hard to use unambiguously⟯.
⟮Most but not all⟯ senses of ⟮markedness⟯ share ⟮a feeling of oddness⟯
A ⟮marked⟯ form, ⟮across most of the⟯ senses, is more ⟮rare⟯.

### implicational scale

⟮Implicational scale⟯ = ⟮implicational hierarchy⟯
If a thing exsists »⟮implicational scale⟯«, if ⟮one thing is present⟯, ⟮all the things⟯ ⟮lower on the scale⟯ ⟮will be as well⟯
If a thing is on an ⟮＿implicational scale＿⟯, and we find that ⟮the e.g. 5th stage is present⟯, we would expect to also find ⟮all four lower stages to be present⟯.
