# arguments

## counting arguments

Verbs have 0 or more arguments.
Valency is the amount of arguments a verb has.
Transitivity is the amount of non-subject arguments a verb has.
Valency = Transitivity + 1 
An ambitransitive verb is one with a transitivity of 0 or 1 (may take an argument or not)

### terminology

Words counting valency are formed with numeral (both latinate and greek are used) + valent
e.g. mono/univalent, divalent, trivalent, tetra/quadrivalent...
Words counting transitivity are formed with numeral (both latinate and greek are used) + transitive

## morphosyntactic alignment

Morphosyntactic alignment is concerned with the distribution of case (incl. word order, but only if it is case-marking) over different valencies.
Morphosyntactic alignment typically varies by language, not within a language.
For the purpose of morphosyntactical alignment, we will consider valencies 1-3 and thus max. three arguments A1, A2, A3
A1, A2, A3 for the purposes of morphosyntactic alignment do not need to be ordered in that way in word order, though they may often have some kind of typical word order.

### A1 A2

Consider verbs with a valency of 1 or 2 and thus 1-2 arguments A1, A2.


valency|nominative-accusative|ergative-absolutive|direct|tripartite|transitive
1|A1=C1|A1=C1|A1=C1|A1=C1|A1=C1
2|A1=C1, A2=C2|A1=C2, A2=C1|A1=C1, A2=C1|A1=C2, A2=C3|A1=C2, A2=C2

Typically, A1 is the agent (sometimes called experiencer in the case of intransitive verbs) while A2 is the patient, though languages often allow deviating from that.
No language can be fully direct or transitive in its alignment, as languages need some way to tell A1 and A2 of a verb with valency = 2 apart.

#### case 

##### ergative-absolutive

table:Case number|case name
C1|absolutive case
C2|ergative case


Because C2 marks A1 of divalent verbs in ergative-absolutive languages and A1 of divalent verbs most often is the agent, it is often said that C2 marks the agent of divalent verbs.
ergative-absolutive is often shortened to ergative.

##### nominative-accusative

table:case number|case name
C1|nominative case
C2|accusative case


In nominative-accusative languages, typically the nominative case is unmarked.
A marked nominative morphsynalign is a nominative-accusative morphsynalign where the nominative case is marked and the accusative case is unmarked.
nominative-accusative is often shortened to accusative.

##### direct

table:case number|case name
C1|direct

##### tripartie

table:case number|case name
C1|intransitive case
C2|ergative case
C3|accusative case

##### transitive

table:case number|case name
C1|intransitive case
C2|transitive case

#### more complex

##### split

A language with split morphosyntactic alignment has different morphosyntactic alignments under different circumstances (syntactic, grammatical, morphological, etc.)
Split ergative alignment is split morphosyntactic alignment between nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive.

##### active

Active alignment has two cases C1, C2 for A1, A2, of v=2 and A1 of v=1 sometimes gets C1 and sometimes C2.
Typically, active alignment decides whether A2 of v=1 gets C1 or C2 based on the agenthood of A1.
There are two types of languages with active alignment, split-S and fluid-S.
split-S and fluid-S are named that way because what I usually call A1 of v=1 is more commonly called S.
Split-S languages have the presumed agenthood of A1 of v=1 calcified into two classes of verbs, which require C1 or C2 respectively.
Fluid-S languages allow speaker choice as to the choice of case of A1 to indicate agenthood.

### A2 A3

alignment|v=2|v=3
dative|A2=CI|A2=CII, A3=CI
dechticaetiative|A2=CI|A2=CI, A3=CII

If v=3, typically A2 is the patient, and A3 is the theme.

#### cases

for both dative and dechticaetiative, CI is whatever the case of A2 was for v=2 (see other level of alignments).
CII is dative for languages with dative morphosyntactic alignment.
CII is dechticaetative for languages with dechticaetative morphosyntactic alignment.
In the case of dative morphsynalign, A2 is called direct and A3 indirect object.
In the case of dechticaetative morphsynalign, A2 is called primary and A3 secondary object.
dative morphsynalign=indirective morphsynalign
dechticaetiative morphsynalign=secundative morphsynalign
Primarily dative langauges often still feature some dechticaetiative behavior.

### merging

oblique case =syn= objective case
The oblique case is an argument-marking case that is not C1 (e.g. nominative or absolutive).
Thus, for nom-accus dative morphsynalign the oblique case can be said to merge dative and accusative cases.
English features an oblique case.

### realization

The most common types of morphosyntactic alignments (narrow) are nominative-accusative followed by ergative-absolutive.
Dative morphsynalign is more common than dechticaetiative.
All languages I speak are nominative-accusative languages.

## semantic roles in monovalent verbs

an unergative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is an agent 
^the most common case
an unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is not an agent.

## voice

Voice is a grammatical feature category which changes the valency of a verb and thus semantic roles of the arguments.
Grammatical voice is either active or passivelike.
The active voice is the default, unmarked voice.
Passivelike voices are voices which decrease the valency by demoting an argument.
Demoting an argument is dropping it or realizing it in some less central way.

### passivelike voices

#### valency > 1

##### passive and antipassive.

The passive voice is the passivelike voice for nominative-accusative languages.
The antipassive voice is the passivelike voice for ergative-absolutive languages.
The passive voice demotes A1 and A2 -> A1.
The antipassive voice demotes A2 and A1 -> A1.
Both the passive and antipassive voice result in C2 -> C1.
For both the passive and antipassive voice, the item that is not demoted keeps its thematic role.
Thus, the passive voice can also be said to make the subject into a patient.

##### middle

The middle voice is a passivelike voice where A1 is both the agent and the patient.
Grammatical voice is generally realized on verbs/VPs.
The mediopassive voice is a grammatical voice that merges the middle voice and the passive voice.

#### valency = 1

The impersonal passive voice is the only passivelike voice which applies to monovalent verbs.
The impersonal passive voice reduces the valency of an monovalent verb to zero.
Some languages may achieve an effect similar to the impersonal passive voice by inserting a dummy element.
