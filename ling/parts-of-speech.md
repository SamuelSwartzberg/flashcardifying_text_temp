## parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar grammatical properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Part of speech may be synonymous with lexcial category if we don't acknowledge functional categories.
a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members
Clear distingction of word classes are difficult across languages.
Often the things we think of a ertain word class doing is actually what a phrase headed by that thing does.

A|Adjective
P|Adposition
Adv|Adverb
Comp|coordinating conjunction
D|Determiner
N|Noun
V|Verb

esp. in generative grammar, functional and lexical categories are often distinguished.
functional category|purely grammatical meaning|Det, Conj, Aux...
lexical category|some sort of semanting content|V, N, A, Adv...

A word that is a member of a functional category is called a function word.
A word that is a member of a lexical category is called a content word.

### particle

A particle is a function word (member of a functional category) which cannot be inflected.
A particle occurring at the end of the sentence is a sentence-final particle.
Particles do not refer.
Sentence-final particles in particular generally indicate modality, register or other pragmatic effects.

### Interjections

An interjection is a lexical item that indicates a reaction. 
Interjections are pretty separated from the rest of the syntax of the sentence.
Interjections are a syntactic category, while discourse marker is a pragmatic category.

### adjective

An adjective (phrase) describes a thing or restricts its referent.
Adjective phrases in english can exist syyntactically in three ways: an attributive adjective, a predicative adjective and a nominalized adjective.
An attributive adjective phrase is adjoined to an NP.
A predicative adjective phrase has the adjective phrase as the complement of the verb.
A nominalized adjective works as the head of an NP.

### adverb

In english at least, adverb(ial) phrases (and thus adverbs) act as a modifier/adjunct for any number of phrases, but not NPs (which is instead handled by APs).
Adverbial phrases describes the thing its modifying.
Adverbs/adverbial phrases are at least able to modify other AdvPs, APs, DPs, PPs, VPs, and IPs.

### noun

Nouns are heads of NPs.
NPs (no DP theory) matter because they are the things that can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions.
If we believe in the DP theory, NPs matter because they are the complements of Ds, and DPs are the things that can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions.

#### attribution

In grammar, something attributive is a phrase within a NP/DP that modifies the head noun. 
Adnnominal seems to be a synonym for attributive
In english, relative clauses and attributive adjectives are the main things that act attributively.
A verb that can be used attributively is known as an attributive verb.

### det

A determiner is a word/affix that occurs that occurs together with a NP and expresses something about the reference of the noun phrase.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner
Types of determiners: Articles, Demonstrative determiners, Quantifiers, distributive determiners, interrogative determiners

#### Quantifier

Quantifiers are a type of determiner/pronoun (which may depending on your analysis may be a quantifier too).
quantifiers are adjoined to the DP/NP to form a larger DP/NP.
table:span=2;⟮DP⟯
⟮Q/D⟯|⟮DP⟯
all|the students

Floating quantifier is a quantifier that is not immediately near the NP/DP it quantifies.
According to the VP-int-subj-hyp, floating quantifiers happen because of the two DPs that could move to the subject position in the specifier position of the IP, the smaller DP moves, leaving the quantifier behind.
The existence of floating quantifiers provides evidence for the VP-internal subject hypothesis by explainin why the quantifier is in this position.

#### Articles

Examples of Articles in EN: the, an, a

#### posessive determiners

my, your, his, her, its, our, their

### adpositions

An adposition may either be a preposition, circumposition or a postposition.
semantically, adpositions may be temporal adpositions, spatial adpositions, or adpositions that mark a different semantic/thematic role.
Adpositions may be transitive or intransitive.
Intransitive adpositions are often called adverbs, though that's probably an inferior analysis.
Intransitive adposition examples: here/everywhere/downstairs/ahead/outside/...
Transitive adpositions may take other adpositions as complements.

### conj

Conjunctions either perform coordination or subordination.

### proforms

Proforms are function words that stand in for another constituent.
DP/NP|Pronouns
NP/N'|one
Verb|do (so)
Temporal adposition|then
Spatial adposition|there
other adposition|none exists

#### pronouns

Pronouns are proforms that stand for NPs, or DPs if we believe in them, not for nouns themselves.

A pro-drop language is a language where certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically or grammatically inferable. 
Japanese and Spanish are pro-drop, German and English are, with rare exceptions, not.

##### personal

Personal pronouns are pronouns that are associated primarily with a particular grammatical person.


### copula (and existential verbs)

A copula is a word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to its complement/predicate.
The tree ☞is☜ blue.
Depending on the language, a copula may or may not be a verb.
An existential verb indicates the existence of something.
In some languages the copula and the main existential verb are the same, of those I speak, only english: to be (The chair is green, there is a god)
In some languages the copula and the main existential verb are different:
es|ser/estar|haber
de|sein|geben
ja|だ|ある・いる

Some languages distinguish different existential verbs for different semantic categories.
Japanese distinguishes its existential verbs ある・いる along a inanimate/animate distinction.

### verbs

#### dynstat

Dynamic and static verbs are often contrasted.
A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action.
A stative (unclear relation to stative aspect) verb is a verb that descirbes a state.
setzen is a dynamic verb while sitzen is a dynamic verb.

#### aux

Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
In English, sentences without auxiliars cannot have negation.
In English, auxiliaries cannot take an object (complement of the VP), while lexical verbs can.
Auxiliary verbs are members of the functional category, while lexical verbs are members of the lexical category.
In English, auxiliaries go before the subject DP/NP in question inversion.
have and do may or may not be auxiliary verbs.
dummy do is do used as an auxiliary verb.
using dummy do is called do-support
do-support is used when an axuliary verb is syntactically required but none is present.

### changing parts of speech

#### nominalization

Nominalization is the process of treating / transforming something which is not a noun as / into a noun / head of an NP.
A nominalizer is a thing, usually a bound morpheme, that nominalizes a thing.
