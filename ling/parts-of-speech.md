# parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar syntactic, word-formation and sometimes semantic properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Clear distingction of word classes are difficult interlinguistically.
Often the things we think of a ertain word class doing is actually what a phrase headed by that thing does.

## closed vs open

a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members

## categories

A part of speech may be a functional, lexical or practical category.

### functional categories

A functional category is a part of speech that purely encodes grammemes (however, those can be semantic roles, thus also encoding semantics).
A word that is a member of a functional category is called a function word.

#### particle

A particle is a function word which cannot be inflected.
A sentence-final particle is a particle occurring at the end of the sentence.
Sentence-final particles in particular generally indicate modality, register or other pragmatic effects.

#### adpositions

Types of adpositions: {post, pre, circum, ambi}
An ambipositon is an adposition that may be either a pre- or postposition depending on other factors.

##### semantics

semantically, adpositions may indicate time, space, various semantic roles, or something else.

##### transitivity

Adpositions may be transitive or intransitive.
A transitive/intransitive takes/does not take a complement.
Intransitive adpositions are often called adverbs, though that's probably an inferior analysis.
Transitive adpositions most commonly take NPs/DPs or other adpositional phrases as complements.

### pragmatic categories

A pragmatic category (my term) is a part of speech that mainly encodes (half of) practs.

#### interjections

Interjection is a pragmatic category that indicates a reaction. 
Interjections are pretty separated from the rest of the syntax of the sentence.
Interjection and discourse marker are often used interchangeably, but interjection refers to the syntactic/morphological class, while discourse marker refers to the pragmatic class.

### lexical category

A lexical category is a part of speech that (also) encodes sememes.
A word that is a member of a lexical category is called a content word.
Sometimes lexical category is used as a synonym for part of speech/word class (but I don't like this).

#### ad

##### adjective

An adjective can act as the head of an AP, or become the head of an NP.
A nominalized adjective is an adjective that has become the N head of an NP.

###### AP

An adjective phrase prototypically describes/restricts the semantics of its head.
An adjective phrase may be attributive or predicative.
An attributive adjective phrase is adjoined to an NP.
A predicative adjective phrase is the complement of the NP.

##### adverb

An adverb is the head of an adverbial phrase.
Adverb(ial) phrases modify any number of things that are not NPs/DPs.
In some sense, adverb and adverb phrase have become a sort of catch-all category.
Semantically, adverbial phrases describe/restrict the thing they're modifying.
In most languages, adverbs/adverbial phrases are at least able to modify other AdvPs, APs, DPs, PPs, VPs, and IPs.

#### noun-related

##### noun

Nouns are heads of NPs.
NPs/DPs are the things that most commonly become subjects/objects. 

###### attribution

Something attributive is a phrase within a NP/DP that modifies the head noun. 
Adnnominal =syn= attributive
An attributive verb is a verb that can be used attributively.

##### det

A determiner is a lexical unit that occurs that occurs together with a NP (DP theory) and expresses something about the reference of the NP.
Types of determiners: Articles, quantifiers, posessive determiners, demonstrative determiners, interrogative determiners

##### Quantifier

A quantifier is a determiner that indicates quantity.

###### Articles

An article is a determiner that typically encodes definiteness, and in many languages also gender, number, and/or case.

###### posessive determiners

A posessive determiner is a determiner instantiating a posessive.

## verbs

### copulas and existential verbs

#### copulas

A copula is a constituent that connects subject with complement=predicate.
The tree ☞is☜ blue.
Copulas are most commonly verbs, but not always.
A pseudocopula/semicopula is a constituent that does similar things as a copula, but is grammatically or syntactically more restricted.

#### existential verbs

An existential verb indicates the existence of something.
Some languages distinguish different existential verbs for different semantic categories or grammatical situations.
Japanese distinguishes its existential verbs ある・いる along a inanimate/animate distinction.

#### in languages

The existential verb and the copula may be the same lexical unit, or a different lexical unit.

en|be|be
es|ser/estar|haber
de|sein|geben
ja|だ|ある・いる

### aux

Auxiliary verbs are function words most commonly indicating verb-related grammemes and/or allowing for more complex syntactic constructions.
Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
modal verbs are a subset of auxiliary verbs that are used to express modality.

#### light verbs

Light verbs are verbs with little semantic content and often used in certain syntactic constructions, but which do not act like auxiliary verbs syntactically.

### lexical

Lexical verbs are verbs that are content words.

#### semantics

##### dynstat

Semantically, lexical verbs can be divided into dynamic and static verbs.
A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action.
A stative verb is a verb that descirbes a state.
^setzen is a dynamic verb while sitzen is a dynamic verb.

## proforms

Proforms are function words or constitutents that stand in for another constituent.

### pronouns

Pronouns are proforms that stand for NPs/DPs.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner

#### pro-drop

A pro-drop language is a language where certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically or grammatically inferable. 
Japanese and Spanish are pro-drop, German and English are, with rare exceptions, not.

#### personal

Personal pronouns are pronouns that are associated primarily with a particular grammatical person.

### changing parts of speech

#### nominalization

Nominalization is the process of treating / transforming something which is not a noun as / into a noun / head of an NP.
A nominalizer is a thing that nominalizes a thing.
Nominalizers are usually bound morphemes.
