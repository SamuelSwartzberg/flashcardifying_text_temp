## kinds of morphemes

### special types

»⟮The root⟯« is ⟮the irreducable morphological core⟯ ⟮of ＿a lexeme＿⟯.

### free and bound morphemes

»⟮A free/bound sm morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮can stand on its own as a word/only appears as part of a larger word⟯.

## processes

Morphological word-formation is morphological lexcreation or inflection.
A morphological process is a process used in morphological word-formation.
Morphological process =types= {concatenative morphological process, discatenative morphological process, modification}
Concatenative/discatenative morphological process =def= g: morphological process; a: addition/removal of morphemes
Modification =def= change of existing morphemes

### concatenative

concatenative process =types= {
  affixation,
  cliticization,
  compounding,
  null process
}

#### affixes

Affixation =def= g: concatenative morphological process; d: attaching of affixes.
»⟮Affixes⟯« are ⟮＿bound morphemes＿⟯ ⟮attached to ＿the base＿⟯ ⟮for ＿word formation＿⟯.
»⟮A base⟯« is ⟮any combination of morphemes⟯ ⟮to which ＿affixes＿ can be attached⟯.

##### use

Depending on ⟮what they're used for⟯, ⟮＿affixes＿⟯ may be ⟮＿inflectional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿derivational＿⟯. // move to process generally
»⟮Inflectional/derivational affixes⟯« are those attached for ⟮＿inflection/(morphological) derivation＿⟯. // move to process generally

##### position

Depending on ⟮its position⟯, an affix may be an ⟮＿adfix＿⟯, ⟮＿infix＿⟯ or ⟮＿circumfix＿⟯ (and less common ones too).
»⟮An adfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ that ⟮goes before ＊or＊ after the base⟯.
»⟮An adfix⟯« is either a ⟮＿a prefix＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿suffix＿⟯.
»⟮A circumfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ that ⟮goes before ＊and＊ after the base⟯.
»⟮An infix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ ⟮inserted into the base⟯.

##### genesis

»⟮A libfix⟯« is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮＿affix＿⟯ created by ⟮＿back-formation＿⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮＿libfixes＿⟯
»⟮A duplfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ produced by ⟮＿reduplication＿⟯.

#### clitics

»⟮Clitics⟯« are ⟮＿bound morphemes＿⟯ that ⟮act like words⟯ regarding ⟮certain syntactic properties⟯.
E.g. It☞'s☜ a boy!, I☞'m☜ terribly sorry., Senatus Populus☞que☜ Romanus
»⟮The host⟯« is ⟮the thing a clitic attaches to⟯.
»⟮Cliticising⟯« is ⟮attaching as a clitic⟯.

##### types

table:name|clitic that appears...
»⟮Enclitic⟯«|⟮after its ＿host＿⟯
»⟮Mesoclitic⟯«|⟮between the stem (or base? not sure) of ＿the host＿ and other affixes⟯
»⟮Proclitic⟯«|⟮before its ＿host＿⟯

#### null 

The null process (my term) is the process of adding a null morpheme.
»⟮A null/zero morpheme⟯« is ⟮＿a morpheme＿⟯ that ⟮has no phonetic form/realization⟯.

### discatenative



### modification

modification =types= {apophony, suppletion }

disfix = morpheme that is subtraction modification
suppletion =def= substitution of the entire morpheme

## disambiguation

### apophony

apophony is ambiguous between apophonymorphology, a synonym to vowel whatever, maybe others
