## kinds of morphemes

### special types

»⟮The root⟯« is ⟮the irreducable morphological core⟯ ⟮of ＿a lexeme＿⟯.

### free and bound morphemes

»⟮A free/bound sm morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮can stand on its own as a word/only appears as part of a larger word⟯.

## processes

Morphological word-formation is morphological lexcreation or inflection.
A morphological process is a process used in morphological word-formation.
Morphological process =types= {concatenative morphological process, discatenative morphological process, modification}
Concatenative/discatenative morphological process =def= g: morphological process; a: addition/removal of morphemes
Modification =def= change of existing morphemes

### concatenative

concatenative process =types= {
  affixation,
  cliticization,
  compounding,
  null process
}

#### affixes

Affixation =def= g: concatenative morphological process; d: attaching of affixes.
»⟮Affixes⟯« are ⟮＿bound morphemes＿⟯ ⟮attached to ＿the base＿⟯ ⟮for ＿word formation＿⟯.
»⟮A base⟯« is ⟮any combination of morphemes⟯ ⟮to which ＿affixes＿ can be attached⟯.

##### use

Depending on ⟮what they're used for⟯, ⟮＿affixes＿⟯ may be ⟮＿inflectional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿derivational＿⟯. // move to process generally
»⟮Inflectional/derivational affixes⟯« are those attached for ⟮＿inflection/(morphological) derivation＿⟯. // move to process generally

##### genesis

»⟮A libfix⟯« is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮＿affix＿⟯ created by ⟮＿back-formation＿⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮＿libfixes＿⟯
»⟮A duplfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ produced by ⟮＿reduplication＿⟯.

##### types

table:name|clitic that appears...
»⟮Enclitic⟯«|⟮after its ＿host＿⟯
»⟮Mesoclitic⟯«|⟮between the stem (or base? not sure) of ＿the host＿ and other affixes⟯
»⟮Proclitic⟯«|⟮before its ＿host＿⟯

#### null 

The null process (my term) is the process of adding a null morpheme.
»⟮A null/zero morpheme⟯« is ⟮＿a morpheme＿⟯ that ⟮has no phonetic form/realization⟯.

### discatenative

disfix = morpheme that is subtraction modification


### modification

modification =types= {apophony⎵morphology⎵, suppletion }

#### apophony

apophony⎵morphology⎵ is modification where the change is a change in sound.
A simulfix is the change via apophony⎵morphology⎵, specifically segmental alternation, but seen as an affix.
A suprafix is the change via apophony⎵morphology⎵, specifically suprasegmental alternation, but seen as an affix.

#### suppletion

suppletion =def= substitution of the entire morpheme

## disambiguation

### apophony

apophony is ambiguous between apophony⎵morphology⎵, a synonym to vowel whatever, maybe others.
Ablaut⎵general⎵ is apophony⎵morphology⎵ where the change in sound is vowel gradation.
Ablaut⎵IE⎵ is ablaut⎵general⎵ but in indo-european.
