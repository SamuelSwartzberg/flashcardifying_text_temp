## kinds of morphemes

### special types

»⟮The root⟯« is ⟮the irreducable morphological core⟯ ⟮of ＿a lexeme＿⟯.

### free and bound morphemes

»⟮A free/bound sm morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮can stand on its own as a word/only appears as part of a larger word⟯.

## processes

Morphological word-formation is morphological lexcreation or inflection.
A morphological process is a process used in morphological word-formation.
Morphological process =types= {concatenative morphological process, discatenative morphological process, modification}
Concatenative/discatenative morphological process =def= g: morphological process; a: addition/removal of morphemes
Modification =def= change of existing morphemes

### concatenative

concatenative process =types= {
  compounding,
  null process
}

#### affixes

##### use

Depending on ⟮what they're used for⟯, ⟮＿affixes＿⟯ may be ⟮＿inflectional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿derivational＿⟯. // move to process generally
»⟮Inflectional/derivational affixes⟯« are those attached for ⟮＿inflection/(morphological) derivation＿⟯. // move to process generally

##### genesis

»⟮A libfix⟯« is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮＿affix＿⟯ created by ⟮＿back-formation＿⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮＿libfixes＿⟯
»⟮A duplfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ produced by ⟮＿reduplication＿⟯.

#### null 

The null process (my term) is the process of adding a null morpheme.
»⟮A null/zero morpheme⟯« is ⟮＿a morpheme＿⟯ that ⟮has no phonetic form/realization⟯.
