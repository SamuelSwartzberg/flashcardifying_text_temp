# information structure

Information structure is the grammeme indicating the relationship of the current thing to larger discourse.
A topic-prominent language is one that places encoding theme/rheme in a high priority in the syntax, ofte featuring explicit morphology for marking information structure.
Japanese, mandarin, korean are all topic-prominent.
Topic is a synonym for theme.
The theme is that information that is being talked about.
The rheme is what is being said about the theme.
Topicalization is marking something as the theme by fronting it.
// subjects are generally topics in unmarked languages, so subject drop is also topic drop (Song, 2017) (which also seems like a good introduction on information structure -> this here is incomplete, see there for more)
