## grammar

Most broadly, grammar is the sets of rules governing a languoid.
A reference grammar is a work on the grammar of a languoid.
A string is grammatical if it conforms to the grammar of a languoid.
A grammaticality judgement is a judgement on the gramatticality of a string by a certain speaker.
grammaticality judgements are often used as linguistic evidence, generative grammar also aims to predict them.
* marks a thing that is ungrammatical.
An empty category is an element that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.
An empty category is often indicated by ø or ＊e＊
A string is a sequence of words that we don't want to put any deeper analytical category on just yet.


## linguistic error

Speech (production) error = mistake
Mistakes and errors are both unintentional deviation from the grammar of a languoid.
An error is a deviation from the grammar of a languoid that is caused by lack of knowledge about the grammar of the languoid.
A mistake is a deviation from the grammar of a languoid that is merely an error in performance, and would ordinarily not have happened.
Typically, only L2 speakers make errors, while anyone can make mistakes.
Errors may also lead to language change.
