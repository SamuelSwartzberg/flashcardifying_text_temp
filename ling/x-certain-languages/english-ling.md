# clauses

## typology

### pragmatic effect

#### interrogative

##### adding constituents

###### tag questions

question tag simple lexemic units: right?, no?, huh?
question tag complex constituent: AUX + PRON

In english, question tag simple lexemic units always produce a question of the same polarity as the declarative clause.
In english, POS declarative clause + POS question tag complex constituent = sarcastic, theoretically POS non-question.
^You know the answer, do you?
In english, POS declarative clause + NEG question tag complex constituent = POS question.
^Nice here, isn't it?
In english, NEG declarative clause + POS question tag complex constituent = NEG question.
^You don't like beetroot, do you?

##### word order

###### english

####### I-to-C movement

In english, wh-questions and yes/no questions alike are marked by I-to-C movement.
In english interrogatives that are not subject questions, the sentence becomes a CP.
In english interrogatives, the newly formed C position is filled by I moving to C.
In english interrogatives, if there is no I to move to C, I is made pronounced via do-support.

####### wh-movement

A wh-question is a interrogative sentence using a wh-word.
Wh-questions typically feature wh-movement.
wh-movement is a form of head movement.
The wh-constituent moves from and therefore its trace is to be found in where it would be in an answer to the question, unless it is in situ.
A wh in situ question is a wh-question where the wh-prhase does not move.
She was reading what? They went where? She spoke to who(m)?
A subject question in english is where the wh-phrase is the subject of the sentence.
Of the wh-questions, subject questions are the only ones that don't feature I to C movement, and thus also no do-support.
the syntax of a subject question has the same syntax as a statement.

Places out of which constituents for wh-questions are impossible to extract   islands
There are a bunch of islands:
- No extraction of one of the conjuncts of a coordinated phrase.
- No extraction out of a CP inside a DP
- No extraction out of a subject (for most English speakers)
- No extraction out of adjuncts
Besides out of islands, wh-movement will be ungrammatical if it does not comply with the shortest move / minimal link condition: The move must be the shortest possible = there must not be a wh-element that would have to move less far.

###### interrogative words ＆ particles

Wh-words are words starting with wh which are nterrogative words creating open questions.
wh-questions are questions created by wh-words.

# connection

## coordination


## subordination

A complement clause is an argument of a predicate.
A complementizer turns a clause into the subject or object of a sentence.
In english, the complementizer 'that' sometimes is unpronounced
Akane thought that Lilly was a いい子. ⇒ Akane thought Lilly was a いい子. 


In english, relative clauses and attributive adjectives are the main things that act attributively.

## floating quant

quantifiers are adjoined to the DP/NP to form a larger DP/NP.
table:span=2;⟮DP⟯
⟮Q/D⟯|⟮DP⟯
all|the students

Floating quantifier is a quantifier that is not immediately near the NP/DP it quantifies.
According to the VP-int-subj-hyp, floating quantifiers happen because of the two DPs that could move to the subject position in the specifier position of the IP, the smaller DP moves, leaving the quantifier behind.
The existence of floating quantifiers provides evidence for the VP-internal subject hypothesis by explainin why the quantifier is in this position.

## aux in en

In English, sentences without auxiliars cannot use negation.
In English, auxiliaries cannot take an object (complement of the VP), while lexemic verbs can.
In English, auxiliaries go before the subject DP/NP in question inversion.
have and do may or may not be auxiliary verbs.
dummy do is do used as an auxiliary verb.
using dummy do is called do-support
do-support is used when an axuliary verb is syntactically required but none is present.
In Question inversion, auxiliary verbs go before the subject DP.

## english proforms


DP/NP|Pronouns
NP/N'|one
Verb|do (so)
Temporal adposition|then
Spatial adposition|there
other adposition|none exists



If english lexemic verbs wanted to move to C in y/n questions, it would have to move to I first (due to the HMC)


##### possessive s

Posessive s is a determiner
Posessor DP cannot be replaced by pronoun
Posessive s is followed by NPs not DPs
Posessive s attaches to DPs
English posessive s is a clitic, german genitive s is an inflectional affix.

###### early modern english

lexemic verbs could move to I, and thus to C, following the HMC.
In current english, wh-questions need do-support since something needs to fill the C position, and the verb can't, since it can't move to I.
In early modern english, wh-questions did not need do-support since the V could move to I and thus to C.
"What heards't thou?"

###### german sentences

The german main clause V2, subordinate clause V-final constituent order is explained as follows:
In german, VP and IP are head-filnal
All german clauses are CPs with pronouced Cs.
Subordinate german clauses have their C positions filled by a complementizer as usual.
If C is not filled by a complementizer (mostly main clauses), then V moves to I and then to C.
In german subordinate clauses, the V can't move to C, because that is typically already filled by a real complementizer.
If in german the V position is occupied by a compound verb, if the V moves (via I to C), what moves is the root, leaving the affix behind.
Main clauses in german have the specifier of C filled by an arbitrary constituent moving there.



In english, the complementizer 'that' sometimes is unpronounced
Akane thought that Lilly was a いい子. ⇒ Akane thought Lilly was a いい子. 

In the passive voice, the subject is not the agent (e.g. patient, them)


### en constituentcy tests

There are many constituency tests in english, among which are: proform, cleft, question, and movement


##### proform

proform test: Substitute the relevant proform, perform a grammaticality judgement
```lang=text;k
The lady running the group handed in her resignation at noon.
The lady running the group did so at noon.
```

##### cleft

cleft test: Move the string into the main clause of a cleft sentence (It was/is x that...)
```lang=text;
The guests from overseas visited the best parts of the city on Monday
It was the best parts of the city that the guests from overseas visited on Monday.
```

##### question

question test: Ask for the string in question with a wh-question.
```lang=text;
The lady running the group handed in her resignation at noon.
What did the lady running the group hand in at noon?
Her resignation.
```

##### movement

Movement test: move string to different position in sentence.
```lang=text;
Gertrude wasn't interested in art.
Interested in art, Gertrude wasn't.
```

### CP role in sentence

CPs may either be complement or adjunct to verb/VP
to test whether a CP is an adjunct or a complement, use a proform test on the Verb/VP without the CP.
