⟮＿Language change＿⟯ is mainly studied in ⟮＿historical linguistics＿⟯.
»⟮Language change⟯« is the ⟮change⟯ in ⟮＿the linguistic items＿⟯ of ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮c_-2;over time⟯.

## what changes?

»⟮e?ic change⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ where the thing that is changing is ⟮a given ＿e?ic unit＿⟯.
»⟮e?ic shift⟯« is ⟮＿e?ic change＿⟯, most often with the additional constraint that it is ⟮a systematic change in the structural system⟯.
»⟮e?ic drift⟯« is ⟮＿e?ic change＿⟯ that is ⟮unconscious/gradual⟯, ⟮pervasive⟯, and ⟮continuous⟯.

### semantic change

Common types of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ are ⟮narrowing/widening⟯, ⟮amelioration/pejoration⟯

#### widening/narrowing

⟮Semantic widening/narrowing⟯ =short=> ⟮widening/narrowing⟯
⟮Widening/narrowing⟯ =syn= ⟮generalization/specialization⟯.
»⟮Widening/narrowing⟯« is the form of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ where ⟮＿a lexemic unit＿⟯ takes on ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ of ⟮one of its ＿hyper/hyponyms＿⟯.
e.g. assassin: specific order of killers -&gt; any killer; starve: die -&gt; die by lack of food; wife: any woman -&gt; woman to whom one is married

#### amelioration/pejoration

⟮amelioration/pejoration⟯ =syn= ⟮elevation/degeneration⟯
»⟮Amelioration/pejoration⟯« is the form of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ of ⟮＿a lexemic unit＿⟯ ⟮becomes more positive/negative⟯.
e.g. pretty: sly -&gt; beautiful; knight: servant -&gt; feudal warrior; villain: serf -&gt; evildoer; knave: servant -&gt; rogue

### lexis

#### relexification

»⟮Relexification⟯« is ⟮＿lexical change＿⟯ that is replacing ⟮most/all⟯ of ⟮＿the lexis＿⟯ ⟮of one languoid with that of another languoid⟯.
^while changing nothing else

## why do things change

### language contact

»⟮Language contact⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ due to ⟮the influence of other languoid(s)⟯.
»⟮Contact linguistics⟯« is the field that studies ⟮＿language contact＿⟯

#### borrowing

»⟮Borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮gaining⟯ ⟮＿a recipium＿⟯ ⟮c-;via⟯ ⟮＿a donum＿⟯ ⟮via⟯ ⟮＿language contact＿⟯.
»⟮The donor/recipient language⟯« is ⟮＿the languoid＿⟯ ⟮whence/wither⟯ ⟮＿the borrowed element(s)＿⟯.
»⟮The preexisting element(s)⟯« (my term) is/are the part(s) of ⟮＿the borrowing linguistic unit＿⟯ that ⟮stay the same in ＿the borrowing＿⟯, if they exist.
»⟮The borrowed element(s)⟯« (my term) is ⟮the thing(s) that is transferred⟯ in ⟮＿a borrowing＿⟯.
»⟮The donor/recipient preexisting element⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the preexisting element＿⟯ in ⟮＿the donor/recipient language＿⟯.
»⟮A borrowing linguistic unit⟯« is the combination of ⟮＿preexisting element(s)＿⟯ and ⟮＿borrowed element(s)＿⟯ in a given language.
»⟮A donum/recipium⟯« is ⟮＿a borrowing linguistic unit＿⟯ in ⟮＿the donor/recipient language＿⟯.

##### categorizing items

»⟮A borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic item＿⟯ ⟮aquired via ＿borrowing＿⟯.
»⟮A native item⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic item＿⟯ that is ⟮not ＿a borrowing＿⟯.

##### borrowed elements

»⟮A sememic/morphemic/lexemic... borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the borrowed elements＿⟯ are ⟮＿sememes/morphemes/lexemes＿⟯.

###### sememes

»⟮A semantic loan⟯« is ⟮＿a sememic borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the preexisting elements＿⟯ are ⟮＿lorphemes＿⟯.
realize (make happen, become aware of) / realisieren (make happen) → realize (make happen, become aware of) / realisieren (make happen, become aware of)
»⟮A loan creation⟯« is ⟮＿a sememic borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the preexisting elements＿⟯ are ⟮＿lorphemes＿⟯, but the ⟮c_;＿lorpheme＿⟯ in ⟮＿the recipient language＿⟯ is ⟮newly created for this purpose⟯.

###### lexemic units

»⟮A foreign word/loanword⟯« is ⟮＿a lexemic unit borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a preexisting element＿⟯ or may be ⟮c_;＿a borrowed element＿ as well⟯ and which ⟮has not/has⟯ ⟮been assimilated phonologically/morphologically/graphemically⟯.

###### morphemes

»⟮A loan formation⟯« is ⟮＿a borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the borrowed element＿⟯ is ⟮a sequence of ＿morpheme signifieds＿⟯ and ⟮＿the preexisting elements＿⟯ are ⟮sets of actual ＿morphemes⟯＿.
»⟮A loan translation/rendition⟯« is ⟮＿a loan formation＿⟯ where ⟮the morpheme signifieds⟯ are realized by ⟮strict/rough translations⟯.
^weekend → Wochenende is a ＿loan translation＿, skyscraper → Wolkenkratzer is a ＿loan rendition/rendering＿
⟮Calque⟯ =syn= ⟮loan translation⟯.
»⟮A loanblend⟯« is ⟮＿a lexemic unit＿⟯ formed using ⟮＿a morphemic borrowing＿⟯.

##### properties

###### learned

»⟮A learned borrowing⎵wide⎵⟯« is a ⟮planned, purposeful⟯ ⟮＿borrowing＿⟯.
A learned borrowing⎵narrow⎵ is ⟮＿a learned borrowing⎵wide⎵＿⟯ from ⟮a classical language⟯.

###### pseudo

⟮pseudo-borrowing⟯ =syn= ⟮false borrowing⟯
»⟮A pseudo/false-borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a lingueme＿⟯ which ⟮seems to be a ＿borrowing＿, but isn't.⟯

## more complex phenomena

### dialect levelling

»⟮Dialect levelling⟯« is ⟮the reduction of ＿linguistic distance＿⟯ of ⟮＿a non-standard variety＿⟯ towards ⟮more similarity with⟯ ⟮c_-;＿the standard variety＿⟯.
Since the industrial revolution, ⟮＿dialect levelling＿⟯ has been ocurring to ⟮most languoids⟯.
