## passivelike voices

### definition

»⟮A passivelike voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical voice＿⟯ which ⟮＿demotes＿ ＿an vlikeのargument＿⟯ and may move logical arguments to different argument slots.

### demoting

»⟮Demoting⟯« ⟮＿an vlikeのargument＿⟯ is ⟮dropping it⟯ or ⟮realizing it as a modifier⟯, thus ⟮decreasing ＿the valency＿ of the verblike⟯.

### valency > 1

#### passive and antipassive.

##### basics

The passive/antipassive voice is a passivelike voice which demotes L(1)/L(2), as a result does L(2)/L(1) → A(1) and thus make sure that A(1) has C1, thus also making A(1) a patient/an agent.

##### unaccusative/unergative

»⟮an unergative/unaccusative verblike⟯« is ⟮＿an intransitive verblike＿⟯ ⟮whose ＿vlikeのargument＿⟯ is/is not ⟮＿an agent＿⟯ 
Unaccusative verbs are typically analyzed as working similar to passive verbs with no L(1), where the single vlikeのargument L(2) starts out in A(2) but moves to A(1).

#### middle

»⟮The middle voice⟯« is ⟮＿a passivelike voice＿⟯ where ⟮A(1)⟯ is ⟮both ＿the agent＿ and ＿the patient＿⟯.
»⟮The mediopassive voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical voice＿⟯ that ⟮merges ＿the middle voice＿ and ＿the passive voice＿⟯.

### valency = 1

»⟮The impersonal passive voice⟯« ⟮＿demotes＿⟯ ⟮the only remaining ＿vlikeのargument＿⟯ of ⟮＿monovalent verblikes＿.
Languoids often achieve an effect similar to ⟮＿the impersonal passive voice＿⟯ by ⟮inserting a ＿dummy element＿⟯.
