# voice

⟮＿Grammatical voice＿⟯ is either ⟮＿the active voice＿⟯ or ⟮＿a passivelike voice＿⟯.

## active voice

»⟮The active voice⟯« is ⟮the default⟯ ⟮＿voice＿⟯ with the ⟮c-;default⟯ ⟮＿valency＿⟯ and thus typically ⟮＿unmarked＿⟯.

## passivelike voices

### definition

»⟮A passivelike voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical voice＿⟯ which ⟮＿demotes＿ ＿an vlikeのargument＿⟯.

### demoting

»⟮Demoting⟯« ⟮＿an vlikeのargument＿⟯ is ⟮dropping it⟯ or ⟮realizing it as a modifier⟯, thus ⟮decreasing ＿the valency＿ of ＿the verblike＿⟯.
In ⟮＿demoting＿ ＿a vlikeのargument＿⟯, ⟮＿logical arguments＿⟯ will ⟮move⟯ to ⟮now empty⟯ ⟮c_-;＿argument slots＿⟯, if any.

### valency > 1

#### passive and antipassive.

##### basics

»⟮The passive/antipassive voice⟯« is ⟮＿a passivelike voice＿⟯ which ⟮＿demotes＿⟯ ⟮L(1)/L(2)⟯, as a result does ⟮c_;L(2)/L(1) → A(1)⟯ and thus make sure that ⟮A(1)⟯ has ⟮C1⟯, making ⟮A(1)⟯ ⟮＿a patient/an agent＿⟯.

##### unaccusative/unergative

»⟮an unergative/unaccusative verblike⟯« is ⟮＿an intransitive verblike＿⟯ ⟮whose ＿vlikeのargument＿⟯ ⟮is/is not⟯ ⟮＿an agent＿⟯ 
⟮＿Unaccusative verbs＿⟯ are typically analyzed as working similar to ⟮＿passive verbs＿⟯ with ⟮no L(1)⟯, where ⟮the single ＿vlikeのargument＿ L(2)⟯ ⟮starts out in A(2)⟯ but ⟮moves to A(1⟯).

#### middle

»⟮The middle voice⟯« is ⟮＿a passivelike voice＿⟯ where conceptually ⟮L1⟯ and ⟮c_;L2⟯, which ⟮are the same entity⟯, both move to ⟮A(1)⟯, which is thus ⟮both ＿the agent＿ and ＿the patient＿⟯.
»⟮The mediopassive voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical voice＿⟯ that ⟮merges ＿the middle voice＿ and ＿the passive voice＿⟯.
