# word formation

»⟮Word formation⟯« is ⟮the creation of new words⟯.

## what is created

⟮＿Word formation＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ or ⟮＿inflection＿⟯.
Ergo, ⟮＿word formation＿⟯ may be used to ⟮express⟯ ⟮c_;＿lexemes＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿grammemes＿⟯ or ⟮c_;a combination of both⟯.

### lexcreation

»⟮Lexcreation⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿word formation＿⟯ as the creation of ⟮new ＿lexemes＿⟯.
⟮＿Lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿morphological＿⟯ or ⟮c_;not⟯.

#### morphological

»⟮Morphological lexcreation⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ via ⟮＿morphology＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphological lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿compounding＿⟯ or ⟮＿morphological derivation＿⟯

##### morphological derivation

»⟮Morphological derivation⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮adding or removing ＿affixes＿⟯.
»⟮A derivate⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ ⟮created via derivation⟯.
⟮＿Morphological derivation＿⟯ may change the ⟮word class⟯, ⟮c_;sememe⟯, or ⟮c_;both⟯.
»⟮A derivational affix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ ⟮used in ＿morphological derivation＿⟯.
»⟮A derivational paradigm⟯« is ⟮the set of words⟯ that ⟮share ＿a stem＿⟯ but ⟮have different ＿derivational affixes＿⟯.

##### hybrid words

»⟮A hybrid word⟯« is ⟮＿a morphological derivation＿⟯ that ⟮derives from at least two different languoids⟯. 
The most common ⟮＿hybrid words＿⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived part⟯
e.g. asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)

##### compounds

»⟮Compounding⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮creating ＿compounds＿⟯.
⟮»A compound«⟯ is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮more than one⟯ ⟮＿compound part＿⟯.
»⟮A compound part⟯« (my term) is ⟮a former ＿lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮becomes a part of ＿a compound＿⟯.

###### finding the meaning

»⟮The head of a compound⟯« (when it exists) is ⟮＿the compound part＿⟯ that is ⟮being modified by⟯ ⟮the other ＿compound parts＿ in the compound⟯.
»⟮An endocentric compound⟯« is one where ⟮＿the head＿⟯ ⟮indicates basic type of ＿sememe＿⟯, ⟮hb;⟮all other ＿compound parts＿⟯ ⟮describe ＿the head＿⟯⟯
»⟮An exocentric compound⟯« is one where ⟮＿the compound parts＿⟯ all ⟮describe aspects of⟯ ⟮some sort of unexpressed ＿sememe＿⟯
»⟮A copulative compound⟯« is one where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ is ⟮c_;the intersection of⟯ ⟮＿the sememes＿ of ＿the compound parts＿⟯ (or roughly so).
An appositional compound is supposedly different from a copulative compound, but I don't see it.
»⟮A dvandva⟯« is ⟮another name for⟯ ⟮＿a copulative/appositional compound＿⟯.
If the english word for siblings was a copulative compound and we believed in the gender binary, it would be brothersister.


table:name|example
⟮endocentric⟯|⟮smalltalk⟯
⟮exocentric⟯|⟮white-collar, scarecrow⟯
⟮copulative⟯|⟮bittersweet, sleepwalk⟯

###### english

In ⟮english⟯, ⟮＿compounds＿⟯ can be ⟮open⟯, ⟮c_;closed⟯ or ⟮c_;hyphenated⟯.
»⟮An open/closed compound⟯« is ＿a compound＿ ⟮containing/not containing⟯ ⟮a space⟯.
In ⟮english⟯, ⟮＿compounds＿⟯ generally ⟮progress⟯ ⟮from open to closed⟯, sometimes ⟮with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.⟯ 
e.g. "To day" → "to-day" → "today"

#### nonmorphological

»⟮Nonmorphological lexcreation⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ that ⟮does not⟯ ⟮directly/completely⟯ ⟮c_-;use morphology⟯.

##### abbreviation

»⟮Abbreviation⟯« is ⟮＿nonmorphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮shortening a word⟯.

###### acronym

»⟮An acronym⟯« is a type of ⟮＿abbreviation＿⟯ formed from ⟮the first letters of other words⟯.
e.g. ATM = automated teller machine; SIA = singapore international airlines
⟮Initialism⟯ =syn= ⟮alphabetism⟯
»⟮An initialism⟯« is ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ which is p⟮ronounced as individual letters⟯.
Sometimes ⟮initialism⟯ is ⟮just a synonym for⟯ ⟮acronym⟯.

####### backronym

»⟮A backronym⟯« is a word that ⟮originally was not⟯ ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ but ⟮c_-;is turned into one⟯.
Examples of backgronyms: SAD ("seasonal affective disorder"), SOS ("Save Our Souls")
More recent examples include the brand name Adidas, named after company founder Adolf "Adi" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sport"; Wiki, said to stand for "What I Know Is", but in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase wiki-wiki meaning "fast"; or Yahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth" (taken from Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels).

###### numeronym

»⟮A numeronym (broad)⟯« is a word ⟮based on/using numbers⟯.
»⟮A numeronym (narrow)⟯« is ⟮＿a numeronym (broad)＿⟯ which is ⟮＿an abbreviation＿⟯.
⟮＿Numeronyms (narrow)＿⟯ frequently either c⟮c_;ount the amount of letters in a word⟯, ⟮c_;have the numbers stand for words thus forming a weird abbreviation⟯, or ⟮c_;use the number metonymically⟯.
Examples for numeronums: 9/11 (date metonym), i18n (letter count), 4649 (weird syllablecronym)

####### instances

table:numeronym|meaning
⟮a11y⟯|⟮accessibility⟯
⟮g11n⟯|⟮globalization⟯
⟮p13n⟯|⟮personalization⟯
⟮i18n⟯|⟮internationalization⟯

#### both/either-or

##### portmanteus

»⟮A splinter⟯« is ⟮a part of ＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮is not ＿a morph＿⟯.
e.g. both 'm' (from 'motor(ist)') and 'otel' (from 'hotel') in motel are splinters.
The terms ⟮portmanteu⟯ and ⟮blend⟯ are ⟮mixed to the point of confusion⟯, ergo I will use neither (defining more specific ones instead).
»⟮A portmanteu word⟯« is ⟮＿a lexcreation＿⟯ where ⟮parts of multiple words⟯ are ⟮combined into a new word/＿morph＿⟯.
»⟮A blend word⟯« is ⟮＿a portmanteu word＿⟯ where ⟮at least one part⟯ is ⟮＿a splinter＿⟯.
»⟮A portmanteu morph⟯« is ⟮the merging of multiple ＿morphs＿⟯ into ⟮one ＿morph＿⟯.
For example, ⟮-t⟯ in spanish might be ⟮＿a portmanteu morph＿⟯ of ⟮the ＿morphs＿ for⟯ ⟮3rd person⟯ and for ⟮c_;singular⟯.
⟮took⟯ may be considered ⟮＿a portmanteu morph＿⟯ of ⟮take + ed⟯.

##### clipping

⟮Clipping⟯ may also be called ⟮truncation⟯ or ⟮shortening⟯.
»⟮Clipping⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮removing⟯ some ⟮＿segments＿ (be those syllables, morphs, phones...)⟯ of a lexeme, but ⟮retaining the original meaning⟯.
e.g. Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu
⟮＿Clipping＿⟯ is also different from ⟮＿back-formation＿⟯, which proceeds by ⟮＿(pseudo-)morpheme＿⟯ rather than ⟮c_;＿segment＿⟯, and where the new word ⟮may differ⟯ in ⟮sense⟯ and/or ⟮c_;word class⟯ from its source.

#### productivity

»⟮productivity⟯« is ⟮the degree to which⟯ ⟮native speakers of a language⟯ ⟮use a particular process⟯ in ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯.
The polar ends of ⟮＿productivity＿⟯ are ⟮productive⟯ and ⟮c_;unproductive⟯.
Lexcreation processses that are applied ⟮very infrequently⟯ are likely ⟮＿unproductive＿⟯.
In english, using ⟮ablauts⟯ to ⟮create preterite verbs⟯ is ⟮＿unproductive＿⟯, while using ⟮c-2;-ed⟯ to ⟮create preterite verbs⟯ is ⟮＿productive＿⟯.

### inflection

»⟮Inflection⟯« is ⟮＿word formation＿⟯ via ⟮the use of ＿inflectional morphemes＿⟯, ergo to indicate ⟮＿grammemes＿⟯.
»⟮An inflectional morpheme⟯« ⟮modifies⟯ ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯.
»⟮An inflectional morpheme⟯« ⟮indicates⟯ ⟮one or more ＿grammemes＿⟯.
The stem is the morpheme that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections.
»⟮An invariable/invariant word⟯« is a word that ⟮cannot be ＿inflected＿⟯.
An inflectional category is a grammatical feature (typically) indicated via inflection.

#### declension and conjugation

»⟮Inflection⟯« can be subdivided into ⟮＿declension＿ and ＿conjugation＿⟯
»⟮Conjugation⟯« is ⟮＿inflection＿⟯ of ⟮verbs⟯
»⟮Declension⟯« is ⟮＿inflection＿⟯ of ⟮nouns or adjectives⟯

#### agreement

»⟮Agreement⟯« is ⟮＿inflection＿⟯ caused by ⟮constraints imposed⟯ by ⟮other words/constituents in the sentence⟯

#### Inflectional paradigm

»⟮An inflectional paradigm⟯« is ⟮the complete set of forms=words⟯ that ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ ⟮can assume⟯ ⟮when ＿inflecting＿⟯
Sometimes, ⟮inflectional paradigm⟯ is (kinda falsely) used as ⟮a synonym⟯ of ⟮inflectional class⟯.
»⟮An inflectional class⟯« is ⟮the set of ＿inflectional morphemes＿⟯ such that ⟮one could generate⟯ ⟮＿the inflectional paradigm＿⟯ of ⟮lexemes falling under ⟮h-4;＿the inflectional class＿⟯⟯ ⟮using only⟯ ⟮the selfsame and the lexeme⟯.
A »⟮typical inflectional class⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿an inflectional class＿⟯ that ⟮unites the ＿inflectional paradigms＿⟯ of ⟮a set of lexemes⟯ ⟮selected by a well-defined criterion (e.g. based on how it ends)⟯
»⟮An inflectional category⟯« is ⟮the subset of elements⟯ of ⟮＿a inflectional class＿⟯ that all ⟮realize a common ＿grammatical feature category＿⟯.
»⟮The inflectional category set⟯« (my term) is ⟮the set of all ＿inflectional categories＿⟯ that ⟮realize a certain ＿grammatical feature category＿⟯.
e.g. case, number
⟮＿A lexeme＿⟯ is »⟮defective⟯« if ⟮＿its inflectional paradigm＿⟯ ⟮lacks some of the forms⟯ of ⟮＿its inflectional class＿⟯.
beware is a verb that is defective, as we can see by the fact that we can't say she bewares (of) the dog.

A lexeme is »⟮regular/irregular⟯« if ⟮＿its inflectional paradigm＿⟯ ⟮does/does not conform to⟯ ⟮＿a typical inflectional class＿⟯.
»⟮A verb class⟯« is ⟮one of⟯ ⟮＿the typical inflectional classes＿⟯ for ⟮verb⟯.

## morphology

»⟮A morpheme⟯« is ⟮the smallest⟯ ⟮＿segment＿⟯ that ⟮corresponds to ＿a sememe＿ or ＿grammeme＿⟯.
⟮One or more⟯ ⟮＿morphemes＿⟯ ⟮form a word⟯.
Ergo, ⟮all of⟯ what ⟮＿morphology＿⟯ does is ⟮＿word formation＿⟯.

### morphs/morphemes 

»⟮Morphs⟯« are ⟮the various phonological realizations⟯ of ⟮＿morphemes＿⟯.
^Morphology generally deals with the phonology and not orthography of morphs/morphemes, as speech is more basic to language than writing⟯. 
The word ⟮unbreakable⟯ consists of ⟮＿the morphemes＿⟯ ⟮un, break, able.⟯ 
⟮＿Morphs＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿morphemes＿⟯ are generally written in ⟮curly braces {}⟯. 
{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /} are all allomorphs of the morpheme {s} (plural s)

#### special types

»⟮A null/zero morpheme⟯« is ⟮＿a morpheme＿⟯ that ⟮has no phonetic form/realization⟯.
»⟮The root⟯« is ⟮the irreducable morphological core⟯ ⟮of ＿a lexeme＿⟯.

#### free and bound morphemes

»⟮A free morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮can stand on its own as a word⟯.
»⟮A bound morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮only appears as part of a larger word⟯.

### processes

#### reduplication

Reduplication is the process in which a morpheme is repeated within a single word

#### attaching stuff

##### affixes

Affixes are bound morphemes attached to the stem for word formation.
A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached.

###### use

Depending on what they're used for, affixes may be inflectional or derivational.
Inflectional affixes are those attached for inflection.
Derivational affixes are those attached for morphological derivation.

###### position

Depending on their position, affixes may be an adfix, infix or circumfix (and less common ones too).
An adfix is an affix that goes before or after the stem.
An adfix may be a prefix or suffix.
A circumfix is an affix that goes before and after the stem.
An infix is an affix inserted into the stem.

###### genesis.

A ⟮libfix⟯ is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮bound morpheme affix⟯ created by ⟮back-formation⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮libfixes⟯

##### clitics

Clitics are bound morphemes that acts like a word in certain syntactic properties, and like an affix in that it can't stand on its own, though the boudnaries are somewhat fuzzy.
The thing that a clitic attaches to is its host.
When something is being attached as a clitic, it is ⟮cliticising⟯
```lang=text;
It☞'s☜ a boy!
I☞'m☜ terribly sorry.
The queen☞'s☜ balls.
I haven☞'t☜ the faintest.
Senatus Populus☞que☜ Romanus
``` 
Enclitic   A clitic that appears after its host
Mesoclitic   A clitic that appears between the stem of the host and other affixes
Proclitic   A clitic that appears before its host

### analysis

A surface analysis is a valid analysis of a lexeme's morphology no matter if etymologically true.
Surface analysis and all derivative terms are most frequently used to describe thereby resultant word formation.
Reanalysis is surface analysis into a different morphology than it originally had.
Juncture loss is reanalysis where an article and a noun fuse.
Juncture loss: al + chemy (from arabic) → alchemy
Rebracketing is also sometimes known as resegmentation or metanalysis
rebracketing is reanalysis into a different set of morphemes, but still a set
rebracketing: hamburger as ham + burger instead of hamburg + er
a folk etymology (or similar) is an etymology that is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation
folk etymology may be used as a synonym to reanalysis, but this is confusing, so I won't
Synonyms: folk etymology, fake etymology, false etymology, pseudoetymology

### typology

Morphological typology is linguistic typology according to a language's morphology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.

#### analytic, synthetic

Analytic languages contain very little inflection and thus have very few (often close to 1) morphemes per word 
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.

highly analytic|chinese, vietnamese
highly synthetic|japanese, turkish

#### interlinear gloss

»⟮A gloss⟯« is ⟮a brief explanation⟯
⟮＿A gloss＿⟯ is most often ⟮placed near the text⟯ ⟮it is explaining⟯
»⟮An interlinear gloss⟯« is ⟮＿a gloss＿⟯ that is ⟮placed between lines.⟯
»⟮A morphological interlinear gloss⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a interlinear gloss＿⟯ to ⟮show the morphology of the string⟯.
»⟮the Leipzig Glossing Rules⟯« are ⟮the (most common set of) rules⟯ for ⟮＿morphological interlinear glossing＿⟯.
Since ⟮the exact morphology⟯ is ⟮not always clear⟯ or ⟮c_;may be at issue⟯, ⟮＿morphological interlinear glossing＿⟯ is generally ⟮for the readers understanding⟯, not ⟮c_;to state an analysis⟯.

##### !leipzig rules

⟮＿Morphological interlinear glosses＿⟯ are ⟮left-aligned⟯ ⟮word-by-word (not morpheme-by-morpheme!⟯
⟮Morphemes within the same word⟯ are ⟮separated by hyphen⟯ both ⟮within the object language⟯ and ⟮in the gloss⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical category labels＿⟯ are ⟮abbreviated labels⟯ for ⟮＿grammatical features＿⟯ rendered in ⟮all caps⟯.
⟮grammatical morphemes⟯ can be rendered by ⟮＿grammatical category labels＿⟯ or ⟮by a word in the metalanguage (e.g. in)⟯ 
the ⟮most common⟯ ⟮＿grammatical category labels＿⟯ may be ⟮further abbreviated⟯.
⟮Clitic boundaries⟯ are marked by ⟮an equals sign⟯.
if ⟮one element in the object language⟯ is ⟮rendered by several elements in the metalanguage⟯, those are ⟮separated by periods⟯ in ⟮the gloss⟯
^there are also optional further category separations here which use _ \ = ; &gt;
Things that are ⟮contained in the gloss⟯ that are ⟮not marked in the object language⟯ may either ⟮be enclosed by []⟯ in ⟮c_;the metalanguage⟯, or ⟮be indicated by ø⟯ in ⟮c_;the object language⟯
