# word formation

Word formation is the creation of new words.

## what is created

Word formation may either be lexcreation or inflection.

### lexcreation

Lexcreation (my term) is word formation as the creation of new lexemes.
Lexcreation may be morphological or not.

#### morphological

Morphological lexcreation is lexcreation via morphology.
Morphological lexcreation may be compounding or morphological derivation

##### morphological derivation

Morphological derivation is morphological lexcreation by adding or removing affixes.
A derivate is a word created via derivation.

##### hybrid words

A hybrid word is a morphological derivation that derives from at least two different languages. 
The most common ⟮hybrid words⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived part⟯
e.g. asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)

##### compounds

Compounding is morphological lexcreation by creating compounds.
A compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one compound parts.
A compound part (my term) is a former lexeme that becomes a part of a compound.

###### finding the maning

The head of a compound is the lexeme that is being modified by the other lexemes in the compound.
An endocentric compound is one where the head indicates basic type of thing, all other compound parts describe the head
An exocentric compound is one where the compound parts all describe aspects some sort of unexpressed thing
A copulative compound is one where the sememe is the intersection of the sememes compound parts (or roughly so).
An appositional compound is supposedly different from a copulative compound, but I don't see it.
A dvandva is another name for a copulative/appositional compound.
If the english word for siblings was a copulative compound and we believed in the gender binary, it would be brothersister.


table:name|example
endocentric|smalltalk
exocentric|white-collar, scarecrow
copulative|bittersweet, sleepwalk

###### english

In english, ⟮compounds⟯ can be open, closed or hyphenated.
An open/closed compound is a compound containing/not containing a spacce.
In english, ⟮compounds⟯ generally ⟮progress from open to closed⟯, sometimes ⟮with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.⟯ 
e.g. "To day" → "to-day" → "today"

#### nonmorphological

Nonmorphological lexcreation is derivation that does not directly/completely use morphology.

##### abbreviation

An abbreviation is nonmorphological lexcreation by shortening a word.

###### acronym

An acronym is a type of abbreviation formed from the first letters of other words.
e.g. ATM = automated teller machine; SIA = singapore international airlines
Initialism = alphabetism
An initialism is an acronym which is pronounced as individual letters.
Sometimes initialism is just a synonym for acronym.

####### backronym

A backronym is a word that originally was not an acronym but is turned into one.
Examples of backgronyms: SAD ("seasonal affective disorder"), SOS ("Save Our Souls")
More recent examples include the brand name Adidas, named after company founder Adolf "Adi" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sport"; Wiki, said to stand for "What I Know Is", but in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase wiki-wiki meaning "fast"; or Yahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth" (taken from Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels).

###### numeronym

A numeronym is a word based on/using numbers.
Most commonly, a numeronym (a number based on/using numbers) is an abbreviation.
Numeronyms as abbreviations frequently either count the amount of letters in a word, have the numbers stand for words thus forming a weird abbreviation, or use the number metonymically.
Examples for numeronums: 9/11 (date metonym), i18n (letter count), 4649 (weird syllablecronym)

####### instances

table:numeronym|meaning
a11y|accessibility
g11n|globalization
p13n|personalization
i18n|internationalization

#### both/either-or

##### portmanteus

A splinter is a part of a lexeme that is not a morph.
e.g. both 'm' (from 'motor(ist)') and 'otel' (from 'hotel') in motel are splinters.
The terms portmanteu and blends are mixed to the point of confusion, ergo I will use neither.
A portmanteu word is a lexcreation where parts of multiple words are combined into a new word/morph.
A blend word is a portmanteu word where at least one part is a splinter.
A portmanteu morph is the merging of multiple morphs into one morph.
For example, -t in spanish might be a portmanteu morph of the morph for 3rd person and for singular.
took may be considered a portmanteu morph of take + ed.

##### clipping

Clipping may also be called truncation or shortening.
Clipping is lexcreation by removing some segments (be those syllables, morphs, phones...) of a lexeme, but retaining the original meaning.
e.g. Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu
Clipping is different from back-formation in that other things than morphemes can be clipped away and that back-formation may change the sense and/or word class.
Clipping is also different from back-formation, which proceeds by (pseudo-)morpheme rather than segment, and where the new word may differ in sense and word class from its source.

#### productivity

productivity is the degree to which native speakers of a language use a particular process in lexcreation.
The polar ends of productivity are productive and unproductive.
Lexcreation processses that are applied very infrequently are likely unproductive.
In english, using ablauts to create preterite verbs is unproductive, while using -ed to create preterite verbs is productive.

### inflection

Inflection is word formation via the use of inflectional morphemes.
An inflectional morpheme modifies a lexeme.
An inflectional morpheme indicates one or more grammemes.
The stem is the morpheme that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections.
An invariable/invariant word is a word that cannot be inflected.

#### declension and conjugation

Inflection can be subdivided into ⟮declension and conjugation⟯
⟮Conjugation⟯ is inflection of ⟮verbs⟯
⟮Declension⟯ is inflection of ⟮nouns or adjectives⟯

#### agreement

Agreement is inflection caused by other words (or similar) in the sentence.

#### Inflectional paradigm

An »inflectional paradigm« is the complete set of forms that a class of words can assume ⟮when inflecting⟯
A »⟮typical inflectional paradigm⟯« (my term) is an inflectional paradigm that is used by a set of words selected by a well-defined criterion (e.g. based on how it ends)
An inflectional category is the subset of elements of a inflection paradigms that all realize a common grammatical feature category.
The inflectional category set (my term) is the set of inflectional categories that exist realizing a common grammatical feature category.
e.g. case, number
A lexeme is defective if it lacks some of the forms of its inflectional paradigm.
beware is a verb that is defective, as we can see by the fact that we can't say she bewares (of) the dog.
A lexeme is regular/irregular if it has/does not have a typical inflectional paradigm.
A verb class is one of the typical inflectional paradigms for verb.

## morphology

Morphemes combine to form words.
^Ergo, all what morphology does is word formation.

## things

### basics 

Morphology is the branch of grammar that studies morphemes and morheme combinations.
A morpheme is the smallest unit of language that corresponds to a sememe or grammeme.
Morphs as etic units are various phonological realization of the morphemes.
⟮Morphology⟯ generally deals with the ⟮phonology⟯ and not ⟮orthography⟯ of morphs/morphemes, as s⟮peech is more basic to language than writing⟯. 
The word ⟮unbreakable⟯ consists of the morpheme ⟮un, break, able.⟯ 
⟮Morphs⟯ and ⟮morphemes⟯ are generally written in ⟮curly braces {⟯}. 
{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /}}} are all ⟮allomorphs⟯ of {{c19::the morpheme {s} (plural s)
A null/zero morpheme is a morpheme that has no phonetic form/realization.
The root is the irreducable morphological core of a lexeme.

### free and bound forms

A free morpheme is one that can stand on its own as a word.
A bound morpheme is one that only appears as part of a larger word.

## processes

### reduplication

Reduplication is the process in which a morpheme is repeated within a single word

### attaching stuff

#### affixes

Affixes are bound morphemes attached to the stem for word formation.
A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached.

##### use

Depending on what they're used for, affixes may be inflectional or derivational.
Inflectional affixes are those attached for inflection.
Derivational affixes are those attached for morphological derivation.

##### position

Depending on their position, affixes may be an adfix, infix or circumfix (and less common ones too).
An adfix is an affix that goes before or after the stem.
An adfix may be a prefix or suffix.
A circumfix is an affix that goes before and after the stem.
An infix is an affix inserted into the stem.

##### genesis.

A ⟮libfix⟯ is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮bound morpheme affix⟯ created by ⟮back-formation⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮libfixes⟯

#### clitics

Clitics are bound morphemes that acts like a word in certain syntactic properties, and like an affix in that it can't stand on its own, though the boudnaries are somewhat fuzzy.
The thing that a clitic attaches to is its host.
When something is being attached as a clitic, it is ⟮cliticising⟯
```lang=text;
It☞'s☜ a boy!
I☞'m☜ terribly sorry.
The queen☞'s☜ balls.
I haven☞'t☜ the faintest.
Senatus Populus☞que☜ Romanus
``` 
Enclitic   A clitic that appears after its host
Mesoclitic   A clitic that appears between the stem of the host and other affixes
Proclitic   A clitic that appears before its host

## analysis

A surface analysis is a valid analysis of a lexeme's morphology no matter if etymologically true.
Surface analysis and all derivative terms are most frequently used to describe thereby resultant word formation.
Reanalysis is surface analysis into a different morphology than it originally had.
Juncture loss is reanalysis where an article and a noun fuse.
Juncture loss: al + chemy (from arabic) → alchemy
Rebracketing is also sometimes known as resegmentation or metanalysis
rebracketing is reanalysis into a different set of morphemes, but still a set
rebracketing: hamburger as ham + burger instead of hamburg + er
a folk etymology (or similar) is an etymology that is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation
folk etymology may be used as a synonym to reanalysis, but this is confusing, so I won't
Synonyms: folk etymology, fake etymology, false etymology, pseudoetymology

## typology

Morphological typology is linguistic typology according to a language's morphology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.

### analytic, synthetic

Analytic languages contain very little inflection and thus have very few (often close to 1) morphemes per word 
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.

highly analytic|chinese, vietnamese
highly synthetic|japanese, turkish

### interlinear gloss

A ⟮gloss⟯ is ⟮a brief explanation⟯, often ⟮placed near the text⟯ ⟮it is explaining⟯
An ⟮interlinear gloss⟯ is ⟮a gloss⟯ that is ⟮placed between lines.⟯
In linguistics, ⟮interlinear glossing⟯ follows the ⟮Leipzig Glossing Rules⟯.
In linguistics, ⟮interlinear glossing following the Leipzig Glossing Rules⟯ is ⟮morpheme⟯-by-⟮morpheme⟯.
In linguistics, interlinear glossing is for the purpose of showing the syntax and morphology of the sentence.
However, since ⟮the exact morphology⟯ is ⟮not always clear⟯ or ⟮may be at issue⟯, ⟮interlinear glossing in linguistics⟯ is generally ⟮for the readers understanding⟯, not ⟮to state an analysis⟯.

Interlinear glossing according to ⟮the Leipzig Glossing Rules⟯:
Interlinear glosses are ⟮aligned⟯ ⟮word-by-word (not morpheme-by-morpheme!⟯), and in this way ⟮left-aligned⟯.
⟮Morphemes within the same word⟯ are ⟮separated by hyphen⟯ both ⟮within the object language⟯ and ⟮in the gloss⟯.
In Interlinear glosses, ⟮grammatical morphemes⟯ can be rendered by ⟮abbreviated lables (e.g. LOC⟯) or
⟮by a word in the metalanguage (e.g. in⟯) In interlienar gloss, ⟮the lables indicating grammatical morphemes⟯ are ⟮written in caps⟯, most commonly ⟮in small caps.⟯
In interlinear gloss, the ⟮most common⟯ of the abbreviated lables may be ⟮further abbreviated⟯.
⟮Clitic boundaries⟯ are marked by ⟮an equals sign⟯.
In interlinear gloss, if ⟮one element in the object language⟯ is ⟮rendered by several elements in the metalanguage⟯, those are ⟮separated in the gloss by periods. (there are also optional further category separations here which use _ \ = ; &gt;⟯) 
Things that are ⟮contained in the gloss⟯ that are ⟮not marked in the object language⟯ may either ⟮be enclosed by []⟯ in ⟮the metalanguage⟯, or ⟮be indicated by ø⟯ in ⟮the object language⟯
