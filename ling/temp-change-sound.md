# changes in sounds

»⟮A change in sound⟯« (my term) is ⟮the change of anything ＿phonic＿⟯ for ⟮any reason⟯.
Types of ＿changes in sounds＿ based on the type of change are amongst others ⟮＿amount modification＿⟯, ⟮＿metasthesis＿⟯, ⟮＿forging＿⟯, ⟮＿transphonologization＿⟯ or ⟮＿similation＿⟯.

## diachronic/synchronic change

»⟮Diachronic/synchronic change in sound⟯« is ⟮＿change in sound＿⟯ ⟮for ＿diachronic＿/＿synchronic＿ reasons/functions⟯.

## change in sound type

### amount modification

#### definition

»⟮change in amount⟯« (my term)  is ⟮＿a change in sound＿⟯ that is the addition or removal of (a) sound(s).
»⟮Elision/Epenthesis⟯« is ⟮＿amount modification＿⟯ that is ⟮removal/addition⟯.

#### both

»⟮Synaeresis⟯« is ⟮＿elision＿⟯ which is ⟮the combination of two adjacent vowels⟯ ⟮into a single syllable.⟯
»⟮Diaresis⟯« is ⟮the occurrence⟯ or ⟮＿epenthesis＿⟯ of/to ⟮two sequential vowels⟯ which are ⟮part of different syllables⟯.

#### elision

##### positional elision

»⟮Positional elision⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿elision＿⟯ based on ⟮where it happens⟯.
»⟮Apheresis⟯« is ⟮＿positional elision＿⟯ from ⟮the beginning of a word⟯
»⟮Syncope⟯« is ⟮＿positional elision＿⟯ from ⟮the interior of a word⟯
»⟮Apocope⟯« is ⟮＿positional elision＿⟯ from ⟮the end of a word⟯

##### details

»⟮Haplology⟯« is ⟮＿elision＿⟯ where ⟮an entire syllable is lost⟯, where ⟮c_;that syllable⟯ was ⟮similar to an adjacent syllable⟯
»⟮Unstressed vowel positional elision/apheresis/syncope/apocope⟯« is ⟮＿positional elision＿/＿apheresis＿/＿syncope＿/＿apocope＿⟯ of ⟮＿unstressed＿ ＿vowels＿⟯, the ⟮most common type⟯.
⟮＿Elision⎵super narrow⎵＿⟯ is ⟮＿apocope＿⟯ that results in ⟮two words being run together⟯.

#### epenthesis

»⟮prothesis⟯« is ⟮＿epenthesis＿⟯ at ⟮the beginning of the word⟯.
»⟮paragoge⟯« is ⟮＿epenthesis＿⟯ at ⟮the end of the word⟯.

### change in order

#### metathesis

»⟮Metathesis⟯« is ⟮＿a change in sound＿⟯ which is ⟮the transposition/switcharoo⟯ of ⟮segments⟯ in ⟮c_;a series of segments⟯
»⟮hyperthesis⟯« is ⟮＿metathesis＿⟯ of ⟮non-adjacent sounds⟯.

```
fo☞li☜age → **fo☞il☜age
ane☞mone☜ → ane☞nome☜
pa☞r☜abo☞l☜a (latin) → pa☞l☜ab☞r☜a
```

### change of contrast

#### transphonologization

»⟮Transphonologization⟯«  is ⟮＿a change in sound＿⟯ which is the change of ⟮＿a phonemic contrast＿⟯ so that ⟮the contrast is preserved⟯, but ⟮the phonic feature it is based on changes⟯.

For example, a language contrasting two words */sat/ vs. */san/ may evolve historically so that final consonants are dropped, yet the modern language preserves the contrast through the nature of the vowel, as in a pair /sa/ vs. /sã/. Such a situation would be described by saying that a former contrast between oral and nasal consonants has been transphonologized into a contrast between oral vs. nasal vowels. 

### change of phonic e?ic units

Alternation⎵change in sound⎵ is a change in sound where one or more phonic e?ic units change.
Gradation is alternation⎵change in sound⎵ where there are fixed grades.

#### type of change

##### lenition ＆ fortition

»⟮forging⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿change in sound＿⟯ which ⟮moves sounds up/down the sonority hierarchy (more/less sonorous)⟯
»⟮Lenition/Fortition⟯« is ⟮＿forging＿⟯ which ⟮moves sounds up/down the sonority hierarchy (more/less sonorous)⟯
^yes, that's the right order.

#### reason

##### environment

###### mutation

Mutation⎵wide⎵ is ⟮＿a change in sound＿⟯ due to its s*m e?ic environment of some kind.

###### reason

The reason for mutation is the kind of environment that induces the mutation

####### basics

The reason for mutation may be morphosyntactic mutation or phonetic mutation.

####### morphosyntactic

Morphosyntactic mutation (rare term) is where the reason for mutation is the morphosyntactic environment

####### phonetic 

Phonetic mutation (rare term) is where the reason for mutation is the phonic environement.

###### process

####### similation

//todo reformulate to use mutationwide
»⟮Similation⟯« is ⟮＿mu＿⟯ in which a phone/phoneme becomes ⟮more/less similar⟯ to ⟮its phonic environment⟯.
»⟮Assimilation/Dissimilation⟯« is ⟮＿similation＿⟯ in which the phone/phoneme becomes ⟮more/less similar⟯ to ⟮its phonic environment⟯. 
^e.g. (assimilation): English "handbag" (canonically /ˈhændbæɡ/) is often pronounced /ˈhæmbæɡ/ in rapid speech 

######## progressive/regressive

Progressive/regressive assimilation/dissimilation is assimilation/dissimilation where something earlier/later influences something later/earlier.

###### combination

####### vowel harmony

vowel harmony⎵weak⎵ is assimilation which is phonetic mutation of vowels, making them share certain sm phonic features.
Backness/Round/Height/Tongue root harmony is vowel harmony where the feature being shared is [back]/[round]/[height]/[root] // TODO check if the feature names are right
vowel harmony⎵strong⎵ is vowel harmony⎵weak⎵ that is long-distance.

####### metaphony

metaphony is assimilation which is phonetic mutation of vowels.
umlaut =syn= metaphony
I-mutation is umlaut where the sound is fronted or raised (made more similar to [i]) when followed by [i] or [j].
Vowel harmony is metaphony

#### what changes

Vowel/consonant/segmental alternation/gradation is alternation⎵change in sound⎵/gradation where what changes is vowels/consonants/segments.
prosodic/suprasegmental alternation is alternation⎵change in sound⎵ where what changes is (a) ssm phonic feature(s).


## where is the change

### cross-segmental

#### sandhi

»⟮Sandhi⟯« is ⟮＿a sound change＿⟯ ⟮at ＿a morpheme boundary＿⟯.
