#  suprasegmental features#

##  distinctive

The main ⟮＿distinctive suprasegmental features/fclasses/feature categories＿⟯ are ⟮＿intonation＿⟯, ⟮＿tone＿⟯, ⟮＿stress＿⟯, ⟮＿tempo＿⟯.

###  stress

⟮accent⟯ =syn= ⟮stress⟯
»⟮Stress⟯« is the feature of the ⟮the relative emphasis⟯ given to a phonic suprasegmental unit within a stress unit.
A stress unit is a grouping of phonic suprasegmental unit into a larger phonic suprasegmental unit.

####  special cases

Fixed stress is stress where the stress always falls on the nth unit within a stress unit.
Word stress =syn= prosodic word stress.
Sentence stress =syn= utterance stress.
lexemic stress is prosodic word stress which is lexemicized.

####  how is stress conveyed

The stress encoder (my term) is a fclass indicating what feature categories are used to encode stress.
The stress encoder may be one or more of the feature categories loudness, length, tone, vowel articulation.
»⟮Dynamic accent⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ encoded by a combination of stress encoder feature categories.

»⟮pitch accent⟯«|pitch
»⟮quantitative accent⟯«|length

####  levels of stress

The level of stress is the fcategory indicating relative strength of the stress.
The level of stress typically has the values primary, secondary.

#####  IPA

the IPA symbols for stress always goes ⟮before⟯ ⟮the stressed element⟯.

⟮primary stress⟯|⟮ˈ (sɐˈbiɐ)⟯
⟮secondary stress⟯|⟮ˌ (ˈfotəˌɡɹæf)⟯

###  pitch

»⟮Tone⟯« is the use of ⟮pitch⟯ for phonemic contrast.
»⟮Intonation⟯« is the use of ⟮pitch⟯ for other things besides phonemic contrast.

####  tone

#####  down/upstep

»⟮A down/upstep⟯« is a ⟮shift of⟯ ⟮＿tone＿⟯ ⟮c-;up/downwards⟯ ⟮after ＿a syllable juncture＿⟯.
⟮＿down/upstep＿⟯ are indicated in the IPA either by ⟮a exlamation point/turned exclamation point⟯ or by a ⟮left⟯ ⟮c_;superscript⟯ ⟮c_;downwards/upwards⟯ ⟮c_;arrow⟯.

⟮Upstep⟯|⟮ꜛ◌ or ꜞ◌⟯
⟮Downstep⟯|⟮ꜜ◌ or ꜝ◌⟯

####  intonation

###  speech tempo

»⟮Speech tempo⟯« is the suprasegmental fcategory of ⟮＿segments＿⟯ ⟮per unit of time⟯.

###  junctures 

»⟮An open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿a phon juncture＿⟯ ⟮at a word boundary⟯.
»⟮An internal open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿an open juncture＿⟯ that is ⟮not marked⟯ by ⟮＿a pause＿⟯ (and thus ⟮c-;does not occur⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of an utterance⟯)
»⟮An external open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿an open juncture＿⟯ that is ⟮marked⟯ by ⟮＿a pause＿⟯ (and thus ⟮c-;occurs⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of an utterance⟯)
»⟮A closed juncture⟯« is ⟮＿a phon juncture＿⟯ ⟮that is not at a word boundary, i.e. word-internal⟯.

##  non-distinctive 

###  rhythm

⟮Rhythm⟯ is a (typically) non-distinctive (but typologically relevant) suprasegmental feature indicating the timing of suprasegmental units

###  isochrony

»⟮Isochrony⟯« is the fcategory of rhythm indicating ⟮which ＿suprasegmental units＿⟯ ⟮occupy equal time⟯.
Isochrony takes on fvalues of the relevant suprasegmental unit.
Most commonly isochrony may take on the fvalues syllable, mora or foot.
A whatever-timed languoid is a languoid with [isochrony: whatever].
Phonetically, isochrony seems to only be a tendency.
Foot-timed =syn= stress-timed
Foot/stress-timing, which unit occupies equal time is actually the interval between two stressed syllables.
