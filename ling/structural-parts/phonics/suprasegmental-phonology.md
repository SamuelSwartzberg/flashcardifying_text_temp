# suprasegmental phonology

## phonemic suprasegmental features

The main ⟮＿phonemic suprasegmental features/feature classes/feature categories＿⟯ are ⟮＿intonation＿⟯, ⟮＿tone＿⟯, ⟮＿stress＿⟯, ⟮＿tempo＿⟯.

### stress

⟮accent⟯ =syn= ⟮stress⟯
»⟮Stress⟯« is the feature of the ⟮the relative emphasis⟯ given to ⟮a certain ＿segment＿⟯

#### what is stressed

The stressed 
»⟮Word stress⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ placed on ⟮syllables⟯ within ⟮c_;words⟯.
»⟮Sentence stress⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ placed on ⟮words⟯ within ⟮c_;sentences⟯.
⟮＿Word stress＿⟯ may be ⟮＿fixed stress＿⟯ or ⟮＿lexical stress＿⟯.
»⟮Fixed stress⟯« is ⟮＿word stress＿⟯ where ⟮the stress always falls on the nth syllable (e.g. the n-1th last in polish)⟯
»⟮Lexical stress⟯« is ⟮＿word stress＿⟯ where ⟮which syllable will be stressed⟯ depends ⟮on the word⟯, and is ⟮lexically encoded⟯.

#### how is stress conveyed

Stress can be conveyed by one or more of the feature categories loudness, length, tone, vowel articulation.

##### names

»⟮Pitch accent⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ ⟮conveyed through pitch alone⟯.
»⟮Quantitative accent⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ ⟮conveyed through length alone⟯.
»⟮Dynamic accent⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ ⟮conveyed through a combination of properties⟯.

#### levels of stress

Sometimes the »⟮levels of stress⟯« ⟮primary⟯ and ⟮c_;secondary⟯ ⟮c_;stress⟯ are distinguished.
the IPA symbols for stress always goes ⟮before⟯ ⟮the stressed element⟯.


table:level of stress|IPA
⟮primary stress⟯|⟮ˈ (sɐˈbiɐ)⟯

### speech tempo

»⟮Speech tempo⟯« is the suprasegmental feature category of ⟮＿segments＿⟯ ⟮per unit of time⟯.

### junctures 

»⟮An open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿a phon juncture＿⟯ ⟮at a word boundary⟯.
»⟮An internal open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿an open juncture＿⟯ that is ⟮not marked⟯ by ⟮＿a pause＿⟯ (and thus ⟮c-;does not occur⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of an utterance⟯)
»⟮An external open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿an open juncture＿⟯ that is ⟮marked⟯ by ⟮＿a pause＿⟯ (and thus ⟮c-;occurs⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of an utterance⟯)
»⟮A closed juncture⟯« is ⟮＿a phon juncture＿⟯ ⟮that is not at a word boundary, i.e. word-internal⟯.

#### pause

»⟮A pause⟯« is ⟮a long⟯ ⟮phon juncture⟯.
While people assume that ⟮any space⟯ marks ⟮＿a pause＿⟯, ⟮in fact most don't⟯.

In the IPA, ⟮the exact length⟯ of ⟮| and ‖⟯ ⟮depends on context⟯.
In the IPA, ⟮|⟯ is used to mark a ⟮longer⟯ pause than ⟮c_-;‖⟯.

##### Other notations

⟮The vertical bar |⟯ is used to mark ⟮feet⟯ in ⟮poetry⟯.
In ⟮poetry⟯, often ⟮the slash⟯ is used to mark ⟮line breaks⟯.


## phonetic-only suprasegmental feature

### rhythm

⟮Rhythm⟯ is a (typically) phonetic-only suprasegmental feature 

### isochrony

»⟮Isochrony⟯« is the feature category rhythm indicating ⟮which ＿segments＿⟯ ⟮occupy equal time⟯.
Isochrony may take on the feature values syllable, mora or stress.
A whatever-timed languoid is a languoid with [isochrony: whatever].
Phonetically, isochrony seems to only be a tendency.
For [isochrony: stress], which unit occupies equal time is actually the interval between two stressed syllables.

### feet (unlear relation to the linguistic category rhythm)

»⟮A foot⟯« is ⟮a rythmic unit⟯ defined by ⟮on which syllable the stress lies.⟯

#### number of feet

## units






### the syllable

#### structure

»⟮The syllable⟯« is ⟮the next higher linguistic unit⟯ for ⟮＿phonemes＿⟯.
⟮＿The syllable＿⟯ is typically represented by ⟮σ⟯.
»⟮The syllable⟯« ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮＿onset＿⟯, ⟮＿nucleus＿⟯ and ⟮＿coda＿⟯.
The ⟮＿onset＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿coda＿⟯ go ⟮before⟯ and ⟮c_;after⟯ ⟮＿the nucleus＿⟯.
⟮＿The nucleus＿⟯ is ⟮mandatory⟯, ⟮c-;＿the onset＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿coda＿⟯ are ⟮optional⟯.
⟮＿The nucleus＿⟯ is ⟮more ＿sonorous＿⟯ than the onset and coda.
⟮＿The onset＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿coda＿⟯ are ⟮less ＿sonorous＿ (than the nucleus)⟯.
Typically, ⟮＿the nucleus＿⟯ is ⟮＿a vowel＿⟯.
Typically, ⟮＿the onset and coda＿⟯ are ⟮＿consonants＿⟯.


When writing syllables, ⟮＿vowels＿⟯ are typically indicated ⟮V⟯ and ⟮c-;＿consonants＿⟯ ⟮C⟯.
»⟮An open syllable⟯« is a ＿syllable＿ ⟮without a ＿coda＿. (CV, V, ...)⟯ 
»⟮A closed syllable⟯« is a ＿syllable＿ ⟮with a ＿coda＿. (CVC, VC, ...) ⟯


»⟮The rhyme⟯« is ⟮the combination of ＿nucleus＿ and (optional) ＿coda＿⟯, since ⟮it's often used for that.⟯

#### words and syllables

table:name|consists of...
»⟮monosyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of a single syllable⟯
»⟮dibisyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of two syllables⟯
»⟮trisyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of three syllables⟯
»⟮polysyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of either more than one or more than three syllables⟯

#### syllable juncture

In the IPA, ⟮spaces⟯ as well as ⟮the stress/secondary stress symbols⟯ imply ⟮a syllable ＿juncture＿⟯.
In the IPA, ⟮［.］⟯ or ⟮［$］⟯ expressedly indicate a ⟮syllable ＿juncture＿⟯.
In the IPA, ⟮［‿］⟯ is used to imply ⟮a space⟯ ⟮without a syllable ＿juncture＿⟯.
