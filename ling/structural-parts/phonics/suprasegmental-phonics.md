# suprasegmental phonology

## suprasegmental units

### the phonological hierarchy

The phonological hierarchy is the ordering of phonic suprasegmental units from largetst to smallest.
The prosodic hierarchy is the subset of the phonological hierarchy from the mora upwards.

#### common phonological hierarchy

1. Utterance
2. Intonation phrase
3. Phonological phrase
4. Accentual phrase
5. Clitic group
6. Phonological word
7. Foot
8. Syllable
9. Mora
10. Phoneme
11. Feature

### units in detail

#### the syllable

##### structure

»⟮The syllable⟯« ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮＿onset＿⟯, ⟮＿nucleus＿⟯ and ⟮＿coda＿⟯.
The ⟮＿onset＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿coda＿⟯ go ⟮before⟯ and ⟮c_;after⟯ ⟮＿the nucleus＿⟯.
⟮＿The nucleus＿⟯ is ⟮mandatory⟯, ⟮c-;＿the onset＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿coda＿⟯ are ⟮optional⟯.
⟮＿The nucleus＿⟯ is ⟮more ＿sonorous＿⟯ than the onset and coda.
⟮＿The onset＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿coda＿⟯ are ⟮less ＿sonorous＿ (than the nucleus)⟯.
Typically, ⟮＿the nucleus＿⟯ is ⟮＿a vowel＿⟯.
Typically, ⟮＿the onset and coda＿⟯ are ⟮＿consonants＿⟯.


When writing syllables, ⟮＿vowels＿⟯ are typically indicated ⟮V⟯ and ⟮c-;＿consonants＿⟯ ⟮C⟯.
»⟮An open syllable⟯« is a ＿syllable＿ ⟮without a ＿coda＿. (CV, V, ...)⟯ 
»⟮A closed syllable⟯« is a ＿syllable＿ ⟮with a ＿coda＿. (CVC, VC, ...) ⟯


»⟮The rhyme⟯« is ⟮the combination of ＿nucleus＿ and (optional) ＿coda＿⟯, since ⟮it's often used for that.⟯

##### words and syllables

table:name|consists of...
»⟮monosyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of a single syllable⟯
»⟮dibisyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of two syllables⟯
»⟮trisyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of three syllables⟯
»⟮polysyllable⟯«|⟮Word that consists of either more than one or more than three syllables⟯

##### syllable juncture

In the IPA, ⟮spaces⟯ as well as ⟮the stress/secondary stress symbols⟯ imply ⟮a syllable ＿juncture＿⟯.
In the IPA, ⟮［.］⟯ or ⟮［$］⟯ expressedly indicate a ⟮syllable ＿juncture＿⟯.
In the IPA, ⟮［‿］⟯ is used to imply ⟮a space⟯ ⟮without a syllable ＿juncture＿⟯.

## distinctive suprasegmental features

The main ⟮＿distinctive suprasegmental features/feature classes/feature categories＿⟯ are ⟮＿intonation＿⟯, ⟮＿tone＿⟯, ⟮＿stress＿⟯, ⟮＿tempo＿⟯.

### stress

⟮accent⟯ =syn= ⟮stress⟯
»⟮Stress⟯« is the feature of the ⟮the relative emphasis⟯ given to a phonic suprasegmental unit within a stress unit.
A stress unit is a grouping of phonic suprasegmental unit into a larger phonic suprasegmental unit.

#### special cases

Fixed stress is stress where the stress always falls on the nth unit within a stress unit.
Word stress =syn= prosodic word stress.
Sentence stress =syn= utterance stress.
Lexical stress is prosodic word stress which is lexicalized.

#### how is stress conveyed

The stress encoder (my term) is a feature class indicating what feature categories are used to encode stress.
The stress encoder may be one or more of the feature categories loudness, length, tone, vowel articulation.
»⟮Dynamic accent⟯« is ⟮＿stress＿⟯ encoded by a combination of stress encoder feature categories.


table:name|stress encoder
»⟮pitch accent⟯«|pitch
»⟮quantitative accent⟯«|length

#### levels of stress

The level of stress is the feature category indicating relative strength of the stress.
The level of stress typically has the values primary, secondary.

##### IPA

the IPA symbols for stress always goes ⟮before⟯ ⟮the stressed element⟯.


table:level of stress|IPA
⟮primary stress⟯|⟮ˈ (sɐˈbiɐ)⟯
⟮secondary stress⟯|⟮ˌ (ˈfotəˌɡɹæf)⟯

### pitch

»⟮Tone⟯« is the use of ⟮pitch⟯ for phonemic contrast.
»⟮Intonation⟯« is the use of ⟮pitch⟯ for other things besides phonemic contrast.

#### tone

##### down/upstep

»⟮A down/upstep⟯« is a ⟮shift of⟯ ⟮＿tone＿⟯ ⟮c-;up/downwards⟯ ⟮after ＿a syllable juncture＿⟯.
⟮＿down/upstep＿⟯ are indicated in the IPA either by ⟮a exlamation point/turned exclamation point⟯ or by a ⟮left⟯ ⟮c_;superscript⟯ ⟮c_;downwards/upwards⟯ ⟮c_;arrow⟯.


table:phenomenon|IPA symbol
⟮Upstep⟯|⟮ꜛ◌ or ꜞ◌⟯
⟮Downstep⟯|⟮ꜜ◌ or ꜝ◌⟯

#### intonation

⟮rise⟯|⟮↗︎◌⟯
⟮fall)⟯|⟮↘︎◌⟯

### speech tempo

»⟮Speech tempo⟯« is the suprasegmental feature category of ⟮＿segments＿⟯ ⟮per unit of time⟯.

### junctures 

»⟮An open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿a phon juncture＿⟯ ⟮at a word boundary⟯.
»⟮An internal open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿an open juncture＿⟯ that is ⟮not marked⟯ by ⟮＿a pause＿⟯ (and thus ⟮c-;does not occur⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of an utterance⟯)
»⟮An external open juncture⟯« is ⟮＿an open juncture＿⟯ that is ⟮marked⟯ by ⟮＿a pause＿⟯ (and thus ⟮c-;occurs⟯ at ⟮the beginning/end of an utterance⟯)
»⟮A closed juncture⟯« is ⟮＿a phon juncture＿⟯ ⟮that is not at a word boundary, i.e. word-internal⟯.

##### Other notations




## non-distinctive suprasegmental feature

### rhythm

⟮Rhythm⟯ is a (typically) non-distinctive (but typologically relevant) suprasegmental feature indicating the timing of suprasegmental units

### isochrony

»⟮Isochrony⟯« is the feature category of rhythm indicating ⟮which ＿suprasegmental units＿⟯ ⟮occupy equal time⟯.
Isochrony takes on feature values of the relevant suprasegmental unit.
Most commonly isochrony may take on the feature values syllable, mora or foot.
A whatever-timed languoid is a languoid with [isochrony: whatever].
Phonetically, isochrony seems to only be a tendency.
Foot-timed =syn= stress-timed
Foot/stress-timing, which unit occupies equal time is actually the interval between two stressed syllables.

## metre

Metre is a system taking advantage of/arising from the suprasegmental phonology of a given languoid.
A metrical suprasegmental unit (my term) is a suprasegmental unit created for/used in metre.
Scansion is determining the metre of something.
A scansion representation system (my term) is a system used to represent a scansion visually.

### foot-based

Foot-based metre is metre based on stanzas, lines and feet.
A stanza is a metrical suprasegmental unit consisting of n lines.
A line is a metrical suprasegmental unit consisting of n feet.
A <greek number>metre is a metre where the lines are <number>feet long.

#### scansion representation

⟮The vertical bar |⟯ is used to mark ⟮feet⟯ in ⟮scansion⟯.
⟮the slash⟯ is used to mark ⟮line breaks⟯ in scansion.
