flex-container:✫nasopharynx.jpg✫✫vocal-tract.jpg✫

»⟮The vocal tract⟯« is ⟮＿the vocal cavities＿⟯ and ⟮the anatomy contained within⟯.
»⟮The vocal cavities⟯« are a set of ⟮four⟯ ⟮cavities⟯ ⟮above⟯ ⟮＿the larynx＿⟯.
»⟮The vocal cavities⟯« specifically are the ⟮＿buccal＿⟯, ⟮＿oral＿⟯, ⟮＿nasal＿⟯ and ⟮＿pharyngeal cavities＿⟯ 
⟮＿Articulation＿⟯ is performed with the ⟮＿the vocal tract＿⟯.
⟮＿The vocal tract＿⟯ is also used for some ⟮＿airstream mechanisms＿⟯.

## buccal cavity

»⟮The buccal cavity⟯« is ⟮the space between⟯ ⟮the teeth⟯ and ⟮c_;the cheeks⟯.

## oral cavity

»⟮The oral cavity⟯« is ⟮the space between⟯ ⟮the pharynx⟯ and ⟮c_;the teeth⟯.
⟮＿The oral cavity＿⟯ ⟮corresponds roughly⟯ to what we would ordinarily call ⟮the mouth⟯.
⟮＿The passive places of articulation＿⟯ from ⟮＿dental＿⟯ to ⟮c_;＿uvular＿⟯ sit within ⟮＿the oral cavity＿⟯.

»⟮The alveolar ridge⟯« is ⟮a gum line⟯ ⟮just behind⟯ ⟮the teeth⟯
»⟮The uvula⟯« is ⟮the bulb⟯ ⟮hanging down⟯⟮ at the entrance⟯ to ⟮＿the pharyngeal cavity＿⟯.
From the front, ⟮the hard palate⟯ ⟮comes before⟯ ⟮the soft palate⟯
⟮The soft palate⟯ is also called ⟮velum⟯.

### tongue

The tongue is divided into three tongue parts.
The tongue parts are: coronum, dorsum and radix.
Something coronal/dorsal/radical involves the coronum/dorsum/radix of the tongue.
The coronum is divided into three coronal parts.
The coronal parts are: subapex, apex, and lamina
laminum =syn= blade
bottom → absolute tip → just behind the tip = subapex → apex → lamina

## nasal cavity

## pharyngeal cavity

»⟮The pharyngeal cavity⟯« is ⟮defined by⟯ ⟮＿the pharynx＿⟯.
⟮＿The pharyngeal cavity＿⟯ is what we would ordinarily call ⟮the throat⟯.
»⟮The pharynx⟯« is a ⟮vertical⟯ ⟮muscular tube⟯.
»⟮The pharynx⟯« sits ⟮on top of⟯ ⟮＿the larynx＿⟯ and ⟮extends up into⟯ ⟮＿the nasal cavity＿⟯.
The pharyx is divided into nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.
The nasopharynx is the part of the pharynx leading into the nasal cavity.
The oropharynx is the part of the pharynx at the back of the vocal cavity.
The laryngopharyx is the part of the pharynx below where it splits into oesophagus and laryngeal inlet.
»⟮The pharynx⟯« as a ⟮＿passive place of articulation＿⟯ is ⟮the back of⟯ ⟮＿the actual pharynx＿⟯.
»⟮The epiglottis⟯« is ⟮a flap⟯ that ⟮sits on top of⟯ and can ⟮seal ＿the laryngeal inlet＿⟯.
If the epiglottis is closed, it contacts the aryepiglottal folds.
The laryngeal inlet is the tube between epiglottis and larynx.

## larynx

⟮Vocal folds⟯ = ⟮vocal cords⟯.
»⟮The larynx⟯« ⟮contains⟯ ⟮＿the vocal folds＿⟯.
»⟮The glottis⟯« is ⟮the gap between⟯ ⟮＿the vocal folds＿⟯.
⟮trachea⟯ = ⟮windpipe⟯.
⟮＿The larynx＿⟯ ⟮sits on top of⟯ ⟮＿the trachea＿⟯.
