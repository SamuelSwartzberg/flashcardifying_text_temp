The speech anatomy is every body part involved in speech production.

## vocal tract

»⟮The vocal tract⟯« is all the anatomy of humans above the larynx until the nasal and oral openings.
⟮＿The vocal tract＿⟯ consists of ⟮＿the vocal cavities＿⟯ and ⟮the anatomy contained within⟯.

### uses

Articulation is performed completely within the vocal tract.
Some aistream mechanisms are performed within the vocal tract.

### the vocal cavities

»⟮A vocal cavity⟯« is a hollow in the vocal tract.
»⟮The vocal cavities⟯« are the four vocal cavities
»⟮The vocal cavities⟯« specifically are the ⟮＿buccal＿⟯, ⟮＿oral＿⟯, ⟮＿nasal＿⟯ and ⟮＿pharyngeal cavities＿⟯ 

### buccal cavity

»⟮The buccal cavity⟯« is ⟮the space between⟯ ⟮the teeth⟯ and ⟮c_;the cheeks⟯.

### oral cavity

»⟮The oral cavity⟯« is ⟮the space between⟯ ⟮the pharynx⟯ and ⟮c_;the teeth⟯.
⟮＿The oral cavity＿⟯ ⟮corresponds roughly⟯ to what we would ordinarily call ⟮the mouth⟯.

#### passive places of articulation

⟮＿The passive places of articulation＿⟯ from ⟮＿dental＿⟯ to ⟮c_;＿uvular＿⟯ sit within ⟮＿the oral cavity＿⟯.
»⟮The alveolar ridge⟯« is ⟮a gum line⟯ ⟮just behind⟯ ⟮the teeth⟯
»⟮The uvula⟯« is ⟮the bulb⟯ ⟮hanging down⟯⟮ at the entrance⟯ to ⟮＿the pharyngeal cavity＿⟯.
From the front, ⟮the hard palate⟯ ⟮comes before⟯ ⟮the soft palate⟯
⟮The soft palate⟯ is also called ⟮velum⟯.

#### active places of articulation

##### tongue

⟮＿The tongue＿⟯ is divided into ⟮three ＿tongue parts＿⟯.
»⟮The tongue parts⟯« are: ⟮＿coronum＿⟯, ⟮＿dorsum＿⟯ and ⟮＿radix＿⟯.
Something »⟮coronal/dorsal/radical⟯« involves ⟮the ＿coronum＿/＿dorsum＿/＿radix＿ of the ＿tongue＿⟯.
The coronum is divided into three coronal parts.
»⟮The coronal parts⟯« are: ⟮＿subapex＿⟯, ⟮＿apex＿⟯, and ⟮＿lamina＿⟯
⟮laminum⟯ =syn= ⟮blade⟯
⟮bottom⟯ → ⟮c_;absolute tip⟯ → ⟮c_;just behind the tip⟯ = ⟮＿subapex＿⟯ → ⟮c_;＿apex＿⟯ → ⟮c_;＿lamina＿⟯

### nasal cavity

### pharyngeal cavity

»⟮The pharyngeal cavity⟯« is ⟮defined by⟯ ⟮＿the pharynx＿⟯.
⟮＿The pharyngeal cavity＿⟯ is what we would ordinarily call ⟮the throat⟯.
»⟮The pharynx⟯« is a ⟮vertical⟯ ⟮muscular tube⟯.
»⟮The pharynx⟯« sits ⟮on top of⟯ ⟮＿the larynx＿⟯ and ⟮extends up into⟯ ⟮＿the nasal cavity＿⟯.

#### parts

The pharyx is divided into nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.
»⟮The nasopharynx⟯« is the part of the pharynx ⟮leading into ＿the nasal cavity＿⟯.
»⟮The oropharynx⟯« is the part of the pharynx ⟮at the back of ＿the vocal cavity＿⟯.
»⟮The laryngopharyx⟯« is the part of the pharynx around where it splits into oesophagus and ＿laryngeal inlet＿.

#### laryngeal inlet, epiglottis

The laryngeal inlet sits at the front of the laryngopharynx, below the oral cavity.
»⟮The epiglottis⟯« is ⟮a flap⟯ that ⟮sits on top of⟯ and ⟮c_;can seal⟯ ⟮＿the laryngeal inlet＿⟯.
the aryepiglottal folds are the part of laryingeal inlet that the epiglottis touches if it is closed.
The laryngeal inlet is the upper part of the larynx.

## larynx

⟮Vocal folds⟯ =syn= ⟮vocal cords⟯.
»⟮The larynx⟯« is a tube full of various features that sits below the epiglottis and on top of the trachea.
The vocal folds are two muscular folds that can constrict the larynx.
»⟮The glottis⟯« is ⟮the gap between⟯ ⟮＿the vocal folds＿⟯.
⟮trachea⟯ =syn= ⟮windpipe⟯.

## openings

»⟮A speech production opening⟯« (my term) is an opening through which sounds escapes to produce speech.
The speech production openings are the nasal opening and the oral opening.
