### inflectional categories

An inflectional category is a sm grammic fcategory that allows a set of inflectional values.
An inflectional value is a sm grammic fvalue/ffeature from the inflectional category's grammic fcategory.

#### defectiveness & regularity

⟮＿A lexeme＿⟯ is »⟮defective⟯« if ⟮＿its inflectional paradigm＿⟯ ⟮lacks some of the forms⟯ of ⟮＿its inflectional class＿⟯.
beware is a verb that is defective, as we can see by the fact that we can't say she bewares (of) the dog.
