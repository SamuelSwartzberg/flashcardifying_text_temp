# morphology

»⟮A morpheme⟯« is ⟮the smallest⟯ ⟮＿segment＿⟯ that ⟮corresponds to ＿a sememe＿ or ＿grammeme＿⟯.
⟮One or more⟯ ⟮＿morphemes＿⟯ ⟮form a word⟯.
Ergo, ⟮all of⟯ what ⟮＿morphology＿⟯ does is ⟮＿word formation＿⟯.

## words

A single-morpheme word is a word which consists of a single free morpheme.
A morphemelike segment (my term) is a morpheme or single-morpheme word.
A worpheme (my term) is a morpheme or a word.
A lorpheme is a morpheme or lexemic unit.

## morphs/morphemes 

»⟮Morphs⟯« are ⟮the various phonological realizations⟯ of ⟮＿morphemes＿⟯.
^Morphology generally deals with the phonology and not orthography of morphs as speech is more basic to language than writing. 
The word ⟮unbreakable⟯ consists of ⟮＿the morphemes＿⟯ ⟮un, break, able.⟯ 
⟮＿Morphs＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿morphemes＿⟯ are generally written in ⟮curly braces {}⟯. 
{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /} are all allomorphs of the morpheme {s} (plural s)

### special types

»⟮A null/zero morpheme⟯« is ⟮＿a morpheme＿⟯ that ⟮has no phonetic form/realization⟯.
»⟮The root⟯« is ⟮the irreducable morphological core⟯ ⟮of ＿a lexeme＿⟯.

### free and bound morphemes

»⟮A free morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮can stand on its own as a word⟯.
»⟮A bound morpheme⟯« is one that ⟮only appears as part of a larger word⟯.

## processes

### reduplication

»⟮Reduplication⟯« is ⟮the repetition of ＿a morpheme＿⟯ ⟮within a single word⟯.

### attaching stuff

#### affixes

»⟮Affixes⟯« are ⟮＿bound morphemes＿⟯ ⟮attached to ＿the base＿⟯ ⟮for ＿word formation＿⟯.
»⟮A base⟯« is ⟮any combination of morphemes⟯ to which affixes can be attached.

##### use

Depending on ⟮what they're used for⟯, ⟮＿affixes＿⟯ may be ⟮＿inflectional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿derivational＿⟯.
»⟮Inflectional affixes⟯« are those attached for ⟮＿inflection＿⟯.
»⟮Derivational affixes⟯« are those attached for ⟮＿morphological derivation＿⟯.

##### position

Depending on ⟮its position⟯, an affix may be an ⟮＿adfix＿⟯, ⟮＿infix＿⟯ or ⟮＿circumfix＿⟯ (and less common ones too).
»⟮An adfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ that ⟮goes before ＊or＊ after the base⟯.
»⟮An adfix⟯« is either a ⟮＿a prefix＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿suffix＿⟯.
»⟮A circumfix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ that ⟮goes before ＊and＊ after the base⟯.
»⟮An infix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ ⟮inserted into the base⟯.

##### genesis.

»⟮A libfix⟯« is a ⟮productive⟯ ⟮＿affix＿⟯ created by ⟮＿back-formation＿⟯, which still ⟮contains some of the original meaning of the word⟯.
⟮-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse⟯ are examples of ⟮＿libfixes＿⟯

#### clitics

»⟮Clitics⟯« are ⟮＿bound morphemes＿⟯ that ⟮act like words⟯ regarding ⟮certain syntactic properties⟯.
E.g. It☞'s☜ a boy!, I☞'m☜ terribly sorry., Senatus Populus☞que☜ Romanus
»⟮The host⟯« is ⟮the thing a clitic attaches to⟯.
»⟮Cliticising⟯« is ⟮attaching as a clitic⟯.

##### types

table:name|clitic that appears...
»⟮Enclitic⟯«|⟮after its host⟯
»⟮Mesoclitic⟯«|⟮between the stem (or base? not sure) of the host and other affixes⟯
»⟮Proclitic⟯«|⟮before its host⟯

## typology

»⟮Morphological typology⟯« is ⟮＿linguistic typology＿⟯ according to⟮ a language's morphology⟯.
The main distinction within ⟮＿morphological typology＿⟯ is ⟮the spectrum between ＿analytic languages＿ and ＿synthetic languages＿⟯.

### analytic, synthetic

»⟮Analytic languages⟯« have ⟮few morphemes per word⟯.
»⟮Synthetic languages⟯« have ⟮many morphemes per word⟯.
⟮＿Synthetic languages＿⟯ can be subdivided into (among others) ⟮＿agglutinative＿⟯ and ⟮＿fusional languages＿⟯.
»⟮fusional languages⟯« ⟮merge⟯ ⟮many different ＿sm grammic feature categories＿⟯ ⟮c_-;into the same morpheme⟯.
»⟮analytic languages⟯« have ⟮different morphemes⟯ for ⟮＿different sm grammic feature categories＿⟯ and ⟮glue those together⟯.

### interlinear gloss

»⟮A gloss⟯« is ⟮a brief explanation⟯
⟮＿A gloss＿⟯ is most often ⟮placed near the text⟯ ⟮it is explaining⟯
»⟮An interlinear gloss⟯« is ⟮＿a gloss＿⟯ that is ⟮placed between lines.⟯
»⟮A morphological interlinear gloss⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a interlinear gloss＿⟯ to ⟮show the morphology of the string⟯.
»⟮the Leipzig Glossing Rules⟯« are ⟮the (most common set of) rules⟯ for ⟮＿morphological interlinear glossing＿⟯.
Since ⟮the exact morphology⟯ is ⟮not always clear⟯ or ⟮c_;may be at issue⟯, ⟮＿morphological interlinear glossing＿⟯ is generally ⟮for the readers understanding⟯, not ⟮c_;to state an analysis⟯.

#### !leipzig rules

⟮＿Morphological interlinear glosses＿⟯ are ⟮left-aligned⟯ ⟮word-by-word (not morpheme-by-morpheme!⟯
⟮Morphemes within the same word⟯ are ⟮separated by hyphen⟯ both ⟮within the object language⟯ and ⟮in the gloss⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical category labels＿⟯ are ⟮abbreviated labels⟯ for ⟮＿sm grammic features＿⟯ rendered in ⟮all caps⟯.
⟮grammatical morphemes⟯ can be rendered by ⟮＿grammatical category labels＿⟯ or ⟮by a word in the metalanguage (e.g. in)⟯ 
the ⟮most common⟯ ⟮＿grammatical category labels＿⟯ may be ⟮further abbreviated⟯.
⟮Clitic boundaries⟯ are marked by ⟮an equals sign⟯.
if ⟮one element in the object language⟯ is ⟮rendered by several elements in the metalanguage⟯, those are ⟮separated by periods⟯ in ⟮the gloss⟯
^there are also optional further category separations here which use _ \ = ; &gt;
Things that are ⟮contained in the gloss⟯ that are ⟮not marked in the object language⟯ may either ⟮be enclosed by []⟯ in ⟮c_;the metalanguage⟯, or ⟮be indicated by ø⟯ in ⟮c_;the object language⟯
