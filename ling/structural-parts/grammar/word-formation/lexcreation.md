»⟮Lexcreation⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿word formation＿⟯ as the creation of ⟮new ＿lexemes＿⟯.
⟮＿Lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿morphological＿⟯ or ⟮c_;not⟯.

## morphological

»⟮Morphological lexcreation⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ via ⟮＿morphology＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphological lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿compounding＿⟯ or ⟮＿morphological derivation＿⟯

### morphological derivation

»⟮Morphological derivation⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮adding or removing ＿affixes＿⟯.
»⟮A derivate⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ ⟮created via derivation⟯.
⟮＿Morphological derivation＿⟯ may change the ⟮word class⟯, ⟮c_;sememe⟯, or ⟮c_;both⟯.
»⟮A derivational affix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ ⟮used in ＿morphological derivation＿⟯.
»⟮A derivational paradigm⟯« is ⟮the set of words⟯ that ⟮share ＿a stem＿⟯ but ⟮have different ＿derivational affixes＿⟯.

### hybrid words

»⟮A hybrid word⟯« is ⟮＿a morphological derivation＿⟯ that ⟮derives from at least two different languoids⟯. 
The most common ⟮＿hybrid words＿⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived part⟯
e.g. asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)

### compounds

»⟮Compounding⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮creating ＿compounds＿⟯.
⟮»A compound«⟯ is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮more than one⟯ ⟮＿compound part＿⟯.
»⟮A compound part⟯« (my term) is ⟮a former ＿lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮becomes a part of ＿a compound＿⟯.

#### finding the meaning

»⟮The head of a compound⟯« (when it exists) is ⟮＿the compound part＿⟯ that is ⟮being modified by⟯ ⟮the other ＿compound parts＿ in the compound⟯.
»⟮An endocentric compound⟯« is one where ⟮＿the head＿⟯ ⟮indicates basic type of ＿sememe＿⟯, ⟮hb;⟮all other ＿compound parts＿⟯ ⟮describe ＿the head＿⟯⟯
»⟮An exocentric compound⟯« is one where ⟮＿the compound parts＿⟯ all ⟮describe aspects of⟯ ⟮some sort of unexpressed ＿sememe＿⟯
»⟮A copulative compound⟯« is one where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ is ⟮c_;the intersection of⟯ ⟮＿the sememes＿ of ＿the compound parts＿⟯ (or roughly so).
An appositional compound is supposedly different from a copulative compound, but I don't see it.
»⟮A dvandva⟯« is ⟮another name for⟯ ⟮＿a copulative/appositional compound＿⟯.
If the english word for siblings was a copulative compound and we believed in the gender binary, it would be brothersister.


table:name|example
⟮endocentric⟯|⟮smalltalk⟯
⟮exocentric⟯|⟮white-collar, scarecrow⟯
⟮copulative⟯|⟮bittersweet, sleepwalk⟯

#### english

In ⟮english⟯, ⟮＿compounds＿⟯ can be ⟮open⟯, ⟮c_;closed⟯ or ⟮c_;hyphenated⟯.
»⟮An open/closed compound⟯« is ＿a compound＿ ⟮containing/not containing⟯ ⟮a space⟯.
In ⟮english⟯, ⟮＿compounds＿⟯ generally ⟮progress⟯ ⟮from open to closed⟯, sometimes ⟮with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.⟯ 
e.g. "To day" → "to-day" → "today"]

### analysis

»⟮A surface analysis⟯« is ⟮a valid analysis⟯ of ⟮a lexeme's morphology⟯ ⟮no matter if etymologically true⟯.
⟮＿Surface analysis＿⟯ and ⟮c_;all derivative terms⟯ are most frequently used to describe ⟮thereby resultant ＿word formation＿⟯.
»⟮Reanalysis⟯« is ⟮＿surface analysis＿⟯ ⟮into a different morphology than it originally had⟯.
»⟮Juncture loss⟯« is ⟮＿reanalysis＿⟯ where ⟮an article and a noun fuse⟯.
⟮＿Juncture loss＿⟯: al + chemy (from arabic) → alchemy
⟮Rebracketing⟯ is also sometimes known as ⟮resegmentation⟯ or ⟮metanalysis⟯
»⟮rebracketing⟯« is ⟮＿reanalysis＿⟯ ⟮into a different set of morphemes⟯, but ⟮still a set⟯
⟮＿rebracketing＿⟯: hamburger as ham + burger instead of hamburg + er
»⟮a folk etymology⟯« (or similar) is ⟮an etymology⟯ that ⟮is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation⟯
⟮folk etymology⟯ may be used ⟮as a synonym to⟯ ⟮reanalysis⟯, but this is confusing, so I won't
Synonyms: folk etymology, fake etymology, false etymology, pseudoetymology

## nonmorphological

»⟮Nonmorphological lexcreation⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ that ⟮does not⟯ ⟮directly/completely⟯ ⟮c_-;use morphology⟯.

### abbreviation

»⟮Abbreviation⟯« is ⟮＿nonmorphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮shortening a word⟯.

#### acronym

»⟮An acronym⟯« is a type of ⟮＿abbreviation＿⟯ formed from ⟮the first letters of other words⟯.
e.g. ATM = automated teller machine; SIA = singapore international airlines
⟮Initialism⟯ =syn= ⟮alphabetism⟯
»⟮An initialism⟯« is ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ which is p⟮ronounced as individual letters⟯.
Sometimes ⟮initialism⟯ is ⟮just a synonym for⟯ ⟮acronym⟯.

##### backronym

»⟮A backronym⟯« is a word that ⟮originally was not⟯ ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ but ⟮c_-;is turned into one⟯.
Examples of backgronyms: SAD ("seasonal affective disorder"), SOS ("Save Our Souls")
More recent examples include the brand name Adidas, named after company founder Adolf "Adi" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sport"; Wiki, said to stand for "What I Know Is", but in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase wiki-wiki meaning "fast"; or Yahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle", but in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth" (taken from Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels).

#### numeronym

»⟮A numeronym (broad)⟯« is a word ⟮based on/using numbers⟯.
»⟮A numeronym (narrow)⟯« is ⟮＿a numeronym (broad)＿⟯ which is ⟮＿an abbreviation＿⟯.
⟮＿Numeronyms (narrow)＿⟯ frequently either c⟮c_;ount the amount of letters in a word⟯, ⟮c_;have the numbers stand for words thus forming a weird abbreviation⟯, or ⟮c_;use the number metonymically⟯.
Examples for numeronums: 9/11 (date metonym), i18n (letter count), 4649 (weird syllablecronym)

##### instances

⟮a11y⟯|⟮accessibility⟯
⟮g11n⟯|⟮globalization⟯
⟮p13n⟯|⟮personalization⟯
⟮i18n⟯|⟮internationalization⟯

## both/either-or

### portmanteus

»⟮A splinter⟯« is ⟮a part of ＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮is not ＿a morph＿⟯.
e.g. both 'm' (from 'motor(ist)') and 'otel' (from 'hotel') in motel are splinters.
The terms ⟮portmanteu⟯ and ⟮blend⟯ are ⟮mixed to the point of confusion⟯, ergo I will use neither (defining more specific ones instead).
»⟮A portmanteu word⟯« is ⟮＿a lexcreation＿⟯ where ⟮parts of multiple words⟯ are ⟮combined into a new word/＿morph＿⟯.
»⟮A blend word⟯« is ⟮＿a portmanteu word＿⟯ where ⟮at least one part⟯ is ⟮＿a splinter＿⟯.
»⟮A portmanteu morph⟯« is ⟮the merging of multiple ＿morphs＿⟯ into ⟮one ＿morph＿⟯.
For example, ⟮-t⟯ in spanish might be ⟮＿a portmanteu morph＿⟯ of ⟮the ＿morphs＿ for⟯ ⟮3rd person⟯ and for ⟮c_;singular⟯.
⟮took⟯ may be considered ⟮＿a portmanteu morph＿⟯ of ⟮take + ed⟯.

### clipping

⟮Clipping⟯ may also be called ⟮truncation⟯ or ⟮shortening⟯.
»⟮Clipping⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮removing⟯ some ⟮＿segments＿ (be those syllables, morphs, phones...)⟯ of a lexeme, but ⟮retaining the original meaning⟯.
e.g. Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu
⟮＿Clipping＿⟯ is also different from ⟮＿back-formation＿⟯, which proceeds by ⟮＿(pseudo-)morpheme＿⟯ rather than ⟮c_;＿segment＿⟯, and where the new word ⟮may differ⟯ in ⟮sense⟯ and/or ⟮c_;word class⟯ from its source.

## productivity

»⟮productivity⟯« is ⟮the degree to which⟯ ⟮native speakers of a language⟯ ⟮use a particular process⟯ in ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯.
The polar ends of ⟮＿productivity＿⟯ are ⟮productive⟯ and ⟮c_;unproductive⟯.
Lexcreation processses that are applied ⟮very infrequently⟯ are likely ⟮＿unproductive＿⟯.
In english, using ⟮ablauts⟯ to ⟮create preterite verbs⟯ is ⟮＿unproductive＿⟯, while using ⟮c-2;-ed⟯ to ⟮create preterite verbs⟯ is ⟮＿productive＿⟯.
