⟮＿Lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿morphological＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿nonmorphological＿⟯.

## morphological

»⟮Morphological lexcreation⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ via ⟮＿morphology＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphological lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿compounding＿⟯ or ⟮＿morphological derivation＿⟯

### process of morphological lexcreation

#### morphological derivation

»⟮Morphological derivation⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮adding or removing ＿derivational affixes＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphological derivation＿⟯ may change the ⟮word class⟯, ⟮c_;sememe⟯, or ⟮c_;both⟯.
morphological derivation =short=> derivation

##### derivational affixes

»⟮A derivational affix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ ⟮used in ＿morphological derivation＿⟯.
»⟮A derivational paradigm⟯« is ⟮the set of words⟯ that ⟮share ＿a stem＿⟯ but ⟮have different ＿derivational affixes＿⟯.

##### derivates

»⟮A derivate⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ ⟮created via derivation⟯.

#### compounds

»⟮Compounding⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮creating ＿compounds＿⟯.
»⟮A compound⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮more than one⟯ ⟮＿compound part＿⟯.
»⟮A compound part⟯« (my term) is ⟮a former ＿lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮becomes a part of ＿a compound＿⟯.

##### head of the compound

The head of the compound is ambiguous between semantic head, syntactic head, and morphological head.
The semantic head of the compound is the compound part of which the compound is a hyponym of, if any.
The syntactic head of the compound is the compound part that determines the word class of the compound.
The morphological head of the compound is the compound part on which inflection is marked.

##### whence the meaning

##### endocentric

An endocentric compound is a compound that has a head.

##### exocentric

An exocentric compound is a compound that does not have a head.
An exocentric compound may be a metonymical compound or a copulative compound.
A metonymical compound is a compound where the compound parts identify a sememe metonymically.
A copulative compound is a compound where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ is ⟮c_;the intersection of⟯ ⟮＿the sememes＿ of ＿the compound parts＿⟯ (or roughly so).
dvandva =syn= appositional compound =syn= copulative compound.

### cause of morphological lexcreation

#### analysis

##### surface analysis

»⟮A surface analysis⎵process⎵⟯« is ⟮a valid analysis⟯ of ⟮a lexeme's morphology⟯ ⟮no matter if etymologically true⟯.
»⟮A surface analysis⎵lexeme⎵⟯« is a lexeme created due to surface analysis⎵process⎵.
Surface analysis is ambiguous between surface analysis⎵process⎵ and surface analysis⎵lexeme⎵.

###### reanalysis

»⟮Reanalysis⎵process/lexeme⎵⟯« is ⟮＿surface analysis⎵process/lexeme⎵＿⟯ ⟮into a different morphology than it originally had⟯.
»⟮Juncture loss⟯« is ⟮＿reanalysis＿⟯ where ⟮an article and a noun fuse⟯.
⟮Rebracketing⟯ is also sometimes known as ⟮resegmentation⟯ or ⟮metanalysis⟯
»⟮rebracketing⟯« is ⟮＿reanalysis＿⟯ which moves a morpheme boundary.
Misdivision (has polysemy) is rebracketing where the morpheme boundary is a word boundary.

##### folk etymology 

»⟮a folk/false/fake etymology⟯« (or similar) is ⟮an etymology⟯ that ⟮is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation⟯
⟮folk/false/fake etymology⟯ may be used ⟮as a synonym to⟯ ⟮reanalysis⟯, but this is confusing, so I won't

### by types of morphemes involved

#### hybrid words

»⟮A hybrid lexeme⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ whose ⟮c_;＿morphemes＿⟯ ⟮derive from at least two different ＿languoids＿⟯. 
^more commonly as 'hybrid word'
The most common ⟮＿hybrid lexeme＿⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived morpheme⟯
e.g. asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)

## nonmorphological

»⟮Nonmorphological lexcreation⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ that does not consider morphemes.

### abbreviation

»⟮Abbreviation⟯« is ⟮＿nonmorphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮shortening a word⟯.

#### acronym

»⟮An acronym⟯« is ⟮＿an abbreviation＿⟯ formed from ⟮the first letters of other words⟯.
e.g. ATM = automated teller machine; SIA = singapore international airlines

##### initialism

⟮Initialism⟯ =syn= ⟮alphabetism⟯
»⟮An initialism⟯« is ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ which is p⟮ronounced as individual letters⟯.
Sometimes ⟮initialism⟯ is ⟮just a synonym for⟯ ⟮acronym⟯.

##### backronym

»⟮A backronym⟯« is ＿a lexeme＿ that ⟮originally was not⟯ ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ but ⟮c_-;is turned into one⟯.
^e.g. SOS ("Save Our Souls")

#### numeronym

»⟮A numeronym⎵broad⎵⟯« is a word ⟮based on/using numbers⟯.
»⟮A numeronym⎵narrow⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a numeronym (broad)＿⟯ which is ⟮＿an abbreviation＿⟯.
A numeronym⎵narrow⎵ may be a count numeronym, a symbolic numeronym, or a metonym numeronym.

##### types

»⟮A count numeronym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a numeronym⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ which uses the first and last letters and the length of the remaining characters in the middle as a number.
^e.g. a11y = accessibility, g11n = globalization, p13n = personalization, i18n = internationalization
»⟮A symbolic numeronym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a numeronym⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ which symbolizes each of its segments with a number.
^e.g. 4649 = よろしく  
»⟮A metonym numeronym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a numeronym⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ which refers metonymically.
^e.g. 3.11

## partially morphological lexcreation

Partially morphological lexcreation is lexcreation that partially or sometimes uses morphemes, and sometimes others/not.

### blends

»⟮A splinter⟯« is ⟮a part of ＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮is not ＿a morph＿⟯.
»⟮A blend⟯« is ⟮＿a partially morphological lexcreation＿⟯ where ⟮at least one part⟯ is ⟮＿a splinter＿⟯.
blend =syn= portmanteu

### clipping

»⟮Clipping⟯« is ⟮＿partially morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮removing some ＿segments＿ of ＿a lexeme＿⟯, but ⟮retaining⟯ ⟮the meaning⟯ and ⟮c_;＿word class＿⟯.
^e.g. Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu

## productivity

»⟮productivity (productive/unproductive)⟯« is ⟮the degree to which⟯ ⟮native speakers of a language⟯ ⟮use a particular process⟯ in ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯.
