⟮＿Lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿morphological＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿nonmorphological＿⟯.

## morphological

»⟮Morphological lexcreation⟯« is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ via ⟮＿morphology＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphological lexcreation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿compounding＿⟯ or ⟮＿morphological derivation＿⟯

### process of morphological lexcreation

#### morphological derivation

»⟮Morphological derivation⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮adding or removing ＿derivational affixes＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphological derivation＿⟯ may change the ⟮word class⟯, ⟮c_;sememe⟯, or ⟮c_;both⟯.
morphological derivation =short=> derivation

##### derivational affixes

»⟮A derivational affix⟯« is ⟮＿an affix＿⟯ ⟮used in ＿morphological derivation＿⟯.
»⟮A derivational paradigm⟯« is ⟮the set of words⟯ that ⟮share ＿a stem＿⟯ but ⟮have different ＿derivational affixes＿⟯.

##### derivates

»⟮A derivate⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ ⟮created via derivation⟯.

#### compounds

»⟮Compounding⟯« is ⟮＿morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮creating ＿compounds＿⟯.
»⟮A compound⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮more than one⟯ ⟮＿compound part＿⟯.
»⟮A compound part⟯« (my term) is ⟮a former ＿lexeme＿ (and thus a set of morphemes)⟯ that ⟮becomes a part of ＿a compound＿⟯.

### cause of morphological lexcreation

#### analysis

##### surface analysis

»⟮A surface analysis⎵process⎵⟯« is ⟮a valid analysis⟯ of ⟮a lexeme's morphology⟯ ⟮no matter if etymologically true⟯.
»⟮A surface analysis⎵lexeme⎵⟯« is a lexeme created due to surface analysis⎵process⎵.
Surface analysis is ambiguous between surface analysis⎵process⎵ and surface analysis⎵lexeme⎵.

###### reanalysis

»⟮Reanalysis⎵process/lexeme⎵⟯« is ⟮＿surface analysis⎵process/lexeme⎵＿⟯ ⟮into a different morphology than it originally had⟯.
»⟮Juncture loss⟯« is ⟮＿reanalysis＿⟯ where ⟮an article and a noun fuse⟯.
⟮Rebracketing⟯ is also sometimes known as ⟮resegmentation⟯ or ⟮metanalysis⟯
»⟮rebracketing⟯« is ⟮＿reanalysis＿⟯ which moves a morpheme boundary.
Misdivision (has polysemy) is rebracketing where the morpheme boundary is a word boundary.

##### folk etymology 

»⟮a folk/false/fake etymology⟯« (or similar) is ⟮an etymology⟯ that ⟮is based on an common-sense/obvious (but false) interpretation⟯
⟮folk/false/fake etymology⟯ may be used ⟮as a synonym to⟯ ⟮reanalysis⟯, but this is confusing, so I won't

### by types of morphemes involved

#### hybrid words

»⟮A hybrid lexeme⟯« is ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ whose ⟮c_;＿morphemes＿⟯ ⟮derive from at least two different ＿languoids＿⟯. 
^more commonly as 'hybrid word'
The most common ⟮＿hybrid lexeme＿⟯ in ⟮english⟯ consist of ⟮one latin-derived and one greek-derived morpheme⟯
e.g. asexual (greek a- and latin sexus), democide (greek demos and latin -cida), automobile (greek autos and latin mobilis)

## nonmorphological

»⟮Nonmorphological lexcreation⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯ that does not consider morphemes.

### abbreviation

»⟮Abbreviation⟯« is ⟮＿nonmorphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮shortening a word⟯.

#### acronym

»⟮An acronym⟯« is ⟮＿an abbreviation＿⟯ formed from ⟮the first letters of other words⟯.
e.g. ATM = automated teller machine; SIA = singapore international airlines

##### initialism

⟮Initialism⟯ =syn= ⟮alphabetism⟯
»⟮An initialism⟯« is ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ which is p⟮ronounced as individual letters⟯.
Sometimes ⟮initialism⟯ is ⟮just a synonym for⟯ ⟮acronym⟯.

##### backronym

»⟮A backronym⟯« is ＿a lexeme＿ that ⟮originally was not⟯ ⟮＿an acronym＿⟯ but ⟮c_-;is turned into one⟯.
^e.g. SOS ("Save Our Souls")

#### numeronym

»⟮A numeronym⎵broad⎵⟯« is a word ⟮based on/using numbers⟯.
»⟮A numeronym⎵narrow⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a numeronym (broad)＿⟯ which is ⟮＿an abbreviation＿⟯.
A numeronym⎵narrow⎵ may be a count numeronym, a symbolic numeronym, or a metonym numeronym.

##### types

»⟮A count numeronym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a numeronym⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ which uses the first and last letters and the length of the remaining characters in the middle as a number.
^e.g. a11y = accessibility, g11n = globalization, p13n = personalization, i18n = internationalization
»⟮A symbolic numeronym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a numeronym⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ which symbolizes each of its segments with a number.
^e.g. 4649 = よろしく  
»⟮A metonym numeronym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a numeronym⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ which refers metonymically.
^e.g. 3.11

## partially morphological lexcreation

Partially morphological lexcreation is lexcreation that partially or sometimes uses morphemes, and sometimes others/not.

### blends

»⟮A splinter⟯« is ⟮a part of ＿a lexeme＿⟯ that ⟮is not ＿a morph＿⟯.
»⟮A blend⟯« is ⟮＿a partially morphological lexcreation＿⟯ where ⟮at least one part⟯ is ⟮＿a splinter＿⟯.
A blend part (my term) is a part of a blend, whether splinter or morpheme.
blend =syn= portmanteu

#### classification by blend part type

A total/partial blend is a blend where all/only some parts are blends (and the others are morphemes/words).

##### total blends

A beginning-end/end-end/beginning-beginning blend is a total blend where the splinters are taken from the beginning&end/end&end/beginningbeginning.

##### partial blends

A morpheme-splinter/splinter-morpheme blend is a partial blend where the morpheme/splinter comes first. 

##### more complex

A intercalated blend is one where a blend part forms a substrate, and (an) other blend part(s) is layered on top, mostly via phonological similarity.
^e.g. adorable + dork = adorkable

#### classification by blend part interaction

Overlapping/non-overlapping blends are blends where one or more sm or ssm graphemes/phonemes overlap/don't overlap.
graphemically/phonologically/graphemophonologically overlapping blends are overlapping blends where one or more sm or ssm graphemes/phonemes/both overlap.

### clipping

»⟮Clipping⟯« is ⟮＿partially morphological lexcreation＿⟯ by ⟮removing some ＿segments＿ of ＿a lexeme＿⟯, but ⟮retaining⟯ ⟮the meaning⟯ and ⟮c_;＿word class＿⟯.
^e.g. Coronavirus → rona, refridgerator → fridge, influenza → flu

## overlapping phenomena

### compends

»⟮A compend⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a compound＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a blend＿⟯.

#### head of the compend

The head of the compend is ambiguous between semantic head, syntactic head, and morphological head.
The semantic head of the compend is the compend part of which the compend is a hyponym of, if any.
The syntactic head of the compend is the compend part that determines the word class of the compend.
The morphological head of the compend is the compend part on which inflection is marked.

#### whence the meaning

#### endocentric

An endocentric compend is a compend that has a head.

#### exocentric

An exocentric compend is a compend that does not have a head.
An exocentric compend may be a metonymical compend or a copulative compend.
A metonymical compend is a compend where the compend parts identify a sememe metonymically.
A copulative compend is a compend where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ is ⟮c_;the intersection of⟯ ⟮＿the sememes＿ of ＿the compend parts＿⟯ (or roughly so).
dvandva =syn= appositional compend =syn= copulative compend.

## productivity

»⟮productivity (productive/unproductive)⟯« is ⟮the degree to which⟯ ⟮native speakers of a language⟯ ⟮use a particular process⟯ in ⟮＿lexcreation＿⟯.
