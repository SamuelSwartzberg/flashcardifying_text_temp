## expletives

»⟮An expletive⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ that is ⟮semantically vacuous⟯.

### syntactic expletive

»⟮A syntactic expletive⟯« is ⟮＿an expletive＿⟯ that is there to ⟮fill ＿a position＿⟯.
^E.g. ⁑There⁑ is someone helping us here. ⁑It⁑ was raining, wasn't ⁑it⁑?

### expletification

»⟮Expletification⟯« (my term) is ⟮the draining of meaning from⟯ ⟮＿lexemic units＿⟯ to ⟮make them expletives⟯. 

## movement

### discontinuities

»⟮A discontinuity⟯« is ⟮two parts⟯ of ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ ⟮being separated⟯ by ⟮an element that is not part of ＿the constituent＿⟯.

### syntactic movement

»⟮Syntactic movement⟯« is ⟮the movement of ＿a constituent＿⟯ ⟮c_;from⟯ ⟮their original place in the syntax tree⟯ ⟮c_-;to⟯ ⟮other places⟯.
⟮＿Syntactic movement＿⟯ aims to ⟮explain/predict⟯ ⟮＿discontinuities＿⟯.
^Syntactic movement is only used by some grammatical theories, and remains controversial.

#### where does something move?

##### fronting

»⟮Fronting⟯« is ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ ⟮to the front of the sentence⟯.

#### what remains?

##### traces

»⟮A trace⟯« is ⟮＿an empty category＿⟯ ⟮left behind by ＿syntactic movement＿⟯.
In chomskyian theories, ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ ⟮always⟯ ⟮leaves ＿a trace＿⟯.
⟮＿Traces＿⟯ are symbolized by ⟮`t`⟯.
»⟮Co-indexing⟯« is ⟮marking⟯ ⟮＿the trace＿⟯ and ⟮c_;the thing that moved⟯ ⟮with a subscript index/letter⟯.

###### evidence

we can't contract over traces.

##### the thing itself

Something »⟮in situ⟯« ⟮doesn't experience ＿syntactic movement＿⟯, although ⟮it normally would⟯.

#### what moves?

⟮＿Syntactic movement＿⟯ may be ⟮＿phrasal movement＿⟯ or ⟮＿head movement＿⟯.

##### phrasal movement

»⟮phrasal movement⟯« is ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ of ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯.

##### head movement

»⟮Head movement⟯« is ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ of ⟮＿a head＿⟯.

###### dependent stranding & pied piping

»⟮dependent stranding⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿head movement＿⟯ that ⟮leaves behind a dependent⟯.
⟮＿Head movement＿⟯ will ⟮always⟯ ⟮result in ＿dependent stranding＿⟯ if ⟮c_-;there are any dependents⟯
»⟮Pied-piping⟯« is ⟮＿phrasal movement＿ instead of ＿head movement＿⟯ to ⟮prevent ＿dependent stranding＿⟯.

###### head movement constraint

»⟮The Head Movement Constraint⟯« is the rule that ⟮＿a head＿ H⟯ ⟮can only move to⟯ ＿a position＿ which ⟮selects HP as its complement⟯.
Under ⟮＿the HMC＿⟯, the only way ⟮c_;＿the HMC＿⟯ can be '⟮skirted⟯' is via ⟮stepwise movement⟯.
⟮＿The head movement contraint＿⟯ ⟮only applies⟯ to ⟮＿head movement＿⟯, obv.

## having/not having content

### unpronounced

Something is »⟮unpronounced⟯« if ⟮it doesn't have any phonological realization (not even silence)⟯.

### empty/overt

»⟮An empty category⟯« is ⟮＿a head＿/＿phrase＿⟯ that is ⟮＿unpronounced＿⟯.
»⟮An overt category⟯« is ⟮＿a head＿/＿phrase＿⟯ that is ⟮not an ＿empty category＿⟯.
⟮＿An empty category＿⟯ is often indicated by ⟮ø⟯ or ⟮＊e＊⟯
