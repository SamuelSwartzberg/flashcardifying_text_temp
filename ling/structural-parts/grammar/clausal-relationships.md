## what is a clause

»⟮A clause⟯« is ⟮a type of ＿constituent＿⟯ ⟮one (conceptual) level higher⟯ than ⟮＿phrases＿⟯.
»⟮A clause⟯« ⟮links⟯ ⟮＿the subject＿⟯ with ⟮＿a predicate (wide sense)＿⟯. 
⟮＿Clauses＿⟯ which ⟮seem to not have ＿a subject＿⟯ have ⟮＿a null subject＿⟯.

### predicate

»⟮A predicate (wide)⟯« is ⟮everything in the clause⟯ ⟮besides ＿the subject＿⟯ which thus ⟮says something about ＿the subject＿⟯.
»⟮A predicate (narrow)⟯« is ⟮the main⟯ ⟮＿verblike＿⟯ ⟮c_-;of the clause⟯, of which ⟮all other parts are arguments⟯.
⟮＿A predicate (wide)＿⟯ ⟮always contains⟯ ⟮＿a predicate (narrow)＿⟯.
^I think, though I suspect this depends on if you believe in zero copulas or similar.
»⟮A copula-based predicate (wide/narrow)⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a predicate (wide)＿⟯ where ⟮＿the predicate (narrow)＿⟯ is ⟮＿a copula (wide/narrow)＿⟯.
⟮＿A copula-based predicate (wide/narrow)＿⟯ consists of ⟮＿a copula (wide/narrow)＿⟯ and ⟮＿a predicative expression＿⟯.
»⟮A predicative expression⟯« is ⟮the part of ＿the copula-based predicate＿⟯ that ⟮says something about ＿the subject＿⟯.
⟮Subject complement⟯ =syn= ⟮predicative expression⟯
⟮Predicative expression⟯ =short=> ⟮predicative⟯

#### predicatives

»⟮A predicative adjective phrase⟯« is ⟮＿an adjective phrase＿⟯ that ⟮acts as ＿a predicative expression⟯＿.

#### special verblikes

##### copulas

»⟮A copula (wide)⟯« is ⟮＿a verblike＿⟯ whose ⟮main function (and semantic content)⟯ is to ⟮connect ＿the subject＿ to ＿the predicative expression＿⟯ in ⟮＿a copula-based predicate＿⟯.
»⟮A copula (narrow)⟯« is ⟮＿a copula (wide)＿⟯ which is ⟮semantically a pure copula⟯.
»⟮A pseudocopula⟯« is ⟮＿a copula (wide)＿⟯ which has ⟮more⟯ ⟮semantic content⟯ or ⟮c_;grammatical constraints⟯ ⟮c_-;than⟯ ⟮＿a copula (narrow)＿⟯
⟮pseudocopula⟯ =syn= ⟮semicopula⟯ 
»⟮Linking verb⟯« is ⟮a vague term⟯, but generally means ⟮＿copula (wide)＿⟯ which is ⟮＿a verb＿⟯.
»⟮A copular verb⟯« is ⟮＿a verb＿⟯ that is ⟮currently acting as ＿a copula (wide)＿⟯.
»⟮A zero copula⟯« is ⟮＿a copula (wide)＿⟯ which is ⟮＿unpronounced＿⟯.

##### existential 

»⟮An existential⟯« is ⟮＿a verblike＿⟯ which ⟮asserts the existence of⟯ ⟮its sole argument⟯.
^Languages may differentiate different existentials for various semantic/grammatical/pragmatic/whatever purposes.
»⟮An existential verb⟯« is ⟮＿an existential＿⟯ which is ⟮＿a verb＿⟯.
»⟮An existential predicate⟯« is ⟮＿a predicate (wide)＿⟯ which ⟮consists entirely of⟯ ⟮＿an existential＿ (plus modifiers)⟯.

##### both

In many languages, ⟮＿copula＿⟯ and ⟮＿existential＿⟯ are ⟮instantiated by the same ＿lexical unit＿⟯.

## typology

### pragmatic effect

#### interrogative

»⟮An interrogative clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ with ⟮＿the pragmatic effect＿⟯ of ⟮＿a question＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogative clauses＿⟯ ⟮are created⟯ using a variety of devices: ⟮＿inflection＿⟯, ⟮word order/syntactic changes⟯, ⟮addition of ＿constituent(s)＿ or ＿lexical unit(s)＿⟯, ⟮＿phonotactic＿ changes⟯ or a combination.
Often, ⟮＿interrogative clauses＿⟯ are indicated ⟮＿graphemically＿⟯ via ⟮special ＿punctuation＿⟯. 

##### interrogatives

⟮Interrogative word⟯ =syn= ⟮interrogative⟯
»⟮An interrogative⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ used ⟮in creating ＿an interrogative clause＿⟯.
»⟮An interrogative particle⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a particle＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogatives＿⟯ may be instantiated by ⟮different ＿parts of speech＿⟯.

##### question (here instead of in → pragmatics for now)

»⟮A question⟯« is a kind of ⟮＿pragmatic effect＿⟯.
⟮＿A question＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a polar question＿⟯, ⟮＿an alternative question＿⟯, or ⟮＿an open question＿⟯.
»⟮A polar question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a  or negation.
»⟮An alternative question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a choice of given alternatives, or a negation.
»⟮An open question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which allows for any number of possible answers (including a negation).

###### polar question

»⟮The polar question polarity⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the polarity＿ of ＿the polar question＿⟯ itself, which ⟮changes ＿the polarity of the presumed response＿⟯.
»⟮The polarity of the presumed response⟯« (my term) is ⟮which⟯ ⟮＿truth/falsity polarity＿⟯ ⟮c_-;of the response⟯ ⟮counts as confirmation/negation of the question⟯.
Languoids may have ⟮either two, three or four⟯ types of ⟮＿polarics＿⟯ that ⟮answer ＿polar questions＿⟯.
If a languoid has ⟮2/4⟯ ⟮types of ＿polarics＿ to answer polar questions⟯, these ⟮do not/do⟯ ⟮distinguish between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation⟯.
A languoid with ⟮3⟯ ⟮types of ＿polarics＿ to answer polar questions⟯ ⟮distinguishes between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation⟯ ⟮only when answering negative polar questions (the hard case)⟯.
A language I speak with ⟮3⟯ types of ＿polarics＿ to answer polar questions is ⟮German⟯.

##### creation

###### adding constituents

####### tag questsions

»⟮A tag question⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative clause＿⟯ which is formed from ⟮＿a declarative clause＿⟯ plus ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯.
⟮＿Tag questions＿⟯ express ⟮＿polar questions＿⟯.
»⟮A question tag⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ required for ⟮creating ＿a tag question＿⟯.
⟮＿A question tag＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a question tag simple lexical unit＿⟯, or ⟮＿a question tag complex constituent＿⟯.
»⟮a question tag simple lexical unit⟯« is ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯ which is ⟮a single ＿lexical unit＿⟯.
»⟮a question tag complex constituent⟯« is ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯ which is ⟮＿a constituent＿ with more complex internal structure⟯.
In ⟮＿a tag question＿⟯, ⟮both ＿the declarative clause＿ and ＿the question tag＿⟯ ⟮can (possibly) have ＿positive/negative polarity＿⟯.
The ⟮four (2*2)⟯ ⟮possible ＿polarity＿ combinations⟯ in ＿a tag question＿ may create ⟮various combinations of⟯ ⟮＿polarity of the expected answer＿⟯ and ⟮＿pragmatic effects＿⟯.
Most languages have ⟮multiple different⟯ question tags.

## (clausal) relationshps

### syntactic

»⟮A independent clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ that ⟮could be a sentence on its own⟯.
»⟮A dependent clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ that ⟮could not be a sentence on its own⟯.
⟮All⟯ dependent clauses ⟮c_;are⟯ subordinate clauses, ⟮c_;but not the reverse⟯.
⟮＿A clause＿⟯ is ⟮＿embedded＿⟯ in ⟮c_-;another ＿clause＿⟯ if ⟮it is part of it⟯.
»⟮A subordinate clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ which is ⟮＿embedded in＿⟯ and thus ⟮in a relationship of ＿subordination＿ with⟯ ⟮another ＿clause＿⟯.
»⟮A superordinate clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ ⟮containing a given ＿subordinate clause＿⟯.
»⟮An embedded clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮is surrounded by its ＿subordinate clause＿⟯.
^ergo one that isn't at the beginning or end of the sentence.
»⟮A matrix clause⟯« is ⟮＿the clause＿⟯ ⟮in which ＿an embedded clause＿ is ＿embedded＿⟯.
»⟮The main clause⟯« is ⟮the part of ＿the superordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮is not ＿the subordinate clause＿⟯.
!^this is a rare definition, but a useful one, and endorsed by Martin Haspelmath
»⟮The root clause⟯« is ⟮the uppermost (tree-wise)⟯ ⟮＿matrix clause＿⟯ ⟮c_-;in the sentence⟯.

#### independent clause

##### (null) subjects

»⟮A null subject⟯« is a ⟮＿unpronounced＿⟯ ⟮c_;＿subject＿⟯.
»⟮A null-subject language⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ which ⟮permits ＿null subjects＿⟯ ⟮in ＿independent clauses＿⟯.
Languages I speak that are ＿⟮null-subject⟯ languages＿ are ⟮spanish⟯ and ⟮c_;japanese⟯.

#### subordinate clauses

##### syntactic relationships

»⟮A complement clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ that ⟮is ＿a verbal argument＿⟯.

##### semantic contents

»⟮An embedded question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯.

##### both, I think

»⟮A relative clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮describes ＿the referent＿ of its head⟯.
»⟮A relative pronoun⟯« is ⟮＿a pronoun＿⟯ that ⟮introduces ＿a relative clause＿⟯.
e.g. I met a furry who was passionate.

### semantic

»⟮The semantic clausal relationship⟯« (my term) is ⟮the semantic relationship⟯ ⟮between two ＿clauses＿ (no matter if coordination or subordination)⟯.


table:name|meaning
»⟮illative⟯«|⟮presents a consequence⟯
»⟮cumulative⟯«|⟮adds more⟯
»⟮adversative⟯«|⟮introduces a contrast⟯
»⟮disjunctive⟯«|⟮introduces a disjunction⟯
»⟮causal⟯«|⟮presents a reason⟯
»⟮purposive⟯«|⟮in order to⟯
»⟮conditional⟯«|⟮introduce a condition⟯
»⟮concessional⟯«|⟮admitting, conceding⟯
»⟮comparative⟯«|⟮comparing⟯
»⟮temporal⟯«|⟮temporal ordering⟯

### result: sentences

»⟮a sentence⟯« is ⟮the largest⟯ ⟮＿constituent＿⟯ and ⟮the root of⟯ ⟮all other ＿constituents＿⟯.
⟮＿A sentence＿⟯ ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮＿clauses＿⟯.
»⟮A one-word sentence⟯« is ⟮＿a sentence＿⟯ consisting of ⟮＿a sentence word＿⟯.
»⟮A sentence word⟯« is ⟮a single ＿lexical unit＿⟯ that ⟮makes up ＿a one-word sentence＿⟯.
^No. Yessir! Ouch!

#### simple/complex 

»⟮A simple sentence⟯« consists of ⟮one ＿clause＿⟯.
»⟮A complex sentence⟯« consists of ⟮more than one ＿clause＿⟯.

#### major/minor

»⟮A major sentence⟯« is a sentence which ⟮we might consider a 'normal sentence' following the usual syntactic rules etc⟯.
»⟮A minor sentence⟯« is a sentence⟮ without the usual subject-predicate structure⟯.
⟮＿Minor sentences＿⟯ are generally quite ⟮＿phrasemic＿⟯.

#### transformation

##### cleft sentence

»⟮A cleft sentence⟯« ⟮splits⟯ ⟮＿a simple sentence＿⟯ ⟮c-;up into⟯ ⟮＿a complex sentence＿⟯. 
⟮＿A cleft sentence＿⟯ typically puts ⟮＿the constituent＿ now in ＿the main clause＿⟯ into ⟮＿focus＿⟯.
Syntax of ⟮＿cleft sentences＿⟯ in english: ⟮it⟯ + ⟮conjugated form of to be⟯ + ⟮X⟯ + ⟮＿subordinate clause＿⟯

## complementization

»⟮Complementizer⟯« is ⟮ambigous between⟯ ⟮＿complementizer (traditional definition)＿⟯ and ⟮＿complementizer (wide)＿⟯.
⟮＿Complementizer＿⟯ is ⟮a POS⟯ and thus gives ⟮rise to its own phrase, CP⟯.
[»⟮CP⟯« ⟮[C]⟯ ⟮[IP]⟯]

### narrow

»⟮a complementizer (traditional definition)⟯« is a head that ⟮transforms a clause into ＿a complement clause＿⟯.
^however, complementizers aren't always necessary for that (or we assume they are unpronounced in those cases)

### broad

»⟮A complementizer (wide)⟯« is a head that ⟮relates⟯ ⟮＿its clause＿⟯ ⟮c_-;to a larger context (the sentence or the discourse)⟯.
Under ⟮＿complementizer (wide)＿⟯, ⟮many⟯ ⟮＿subordinate clauses＿⟯ and ⟮c-;all⟯ ⟮＿interrogative clauses＿⟯ are ⟮typically analyzed as CPs⟯.
There are some arguments that ⟮all ＿clauses＿⟯ are ⟮in fact CPs⟯.
