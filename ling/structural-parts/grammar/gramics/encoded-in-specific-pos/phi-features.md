# phi-features (noun-related)

»⟮the phi-features⟯« are ⟮a group of⟯ ⟮＿grammatical feature categories＿⟯ ⟮related to ＿nouns＿⟯ which are encoded ⟮＿inflectionally＿⟯.
»⟮A phi-feature⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical feature category＿⟯ that is ⟮one of ＿the phi-features＿⟯.
⟮＿The phi-features＿⟯ ⟮often force⟯ ⟮＿agreement＿⟯ on ⟮noun-related things⟯, and sometimes on ⟮c_;verbs⟯ too.
⟮＿The phi-features＿⟯ include ⟮＿number＿⟯, ⟮＿noun class＿⟯ and ⟮＿case＿⟯.

## noun class

»⟮Noun class⟯« is ⟮＿a phi-feature＿⟯ encoding ⟮a variety of different semantic distinctions⟯.
Typically, if a languages has them, ⟮any given noun⟯ has a ⟮fixed⟯ ⟮＿noun class＿⟯ ⟮associated with it⟯.
»⟮Grammatical gender⟯« is a type of ⟮＿noun-class system＿⟯ where ⟮＿the grammemes＿ distinguished⟯ are ⟮male, female, and possibly neuter⟯.

### classifier

»⟮A classifier⟯« is ⟮a morpheme or lexeme⟯ that ⟮fulfills a function similar to ＿noun class＿⟯.
»⟮A measure word⟯« is ⟮＿a classifier＿⟯ ⟮that 'targets' a ＿numeral＿⟯.
^perhaps there are no other classifiers than measure words, in which case they would be synonymous
»⟮A numeral quantifier⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮＿a numeral＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿a measure word＿⟯.

## number

»⟮Grammatical number⟯« is ⟮＿a phi-feature＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿sememes/semic features＿⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the semantic (feature)＿ category⟯ ⟮setlike⟯
⟮＿Grammatical number＿⟯ may be ⟮＿amount number＿⟯ or ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯

### amount

»⟮Amount number⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿grammatical number＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿amount＿ ＿semic features＿⟯.


table:name|amount
»⟮Singular⟯«|⟮one⟯
»⟮Dual⟯«|⟮two⟯
»⟮Trial⟯«|⟮three⟯
»⟮Paucal⟯«|⟮a few⟯
»⟮Plural⟯«|⟮more than any of the other numbers available in the language⟯


If a languoid has ⟮＿amount number＿⟯, ⟮most commonly⟯ it ⟮only has⟯ t⟮he two ＿grammemes＿ ＿singular/plural＿⟯.
In languoids with ⟮a ＿singular/plural＿ distinction⟯, most often ⟮＿the singular＿⟯ is ⟮the ＿unmarked＿ form⟯.

#### grouping

»⟮Grouping number⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿grammatical number＿⟯ encoding ⟮the ＿distributivity＿ ＿semic feature＿⟯.
The grammemes of ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯ are most commonly ⟮＿singulative＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿collective＿⟯.
The »⟮collective⟯« ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯ encodes ⟮[+collective] [+group]⟯.
The »⟮singulative⟯« ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯ encodes ⟮[-collective] [-group]⟯.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the ⟮＿collective＿⟯ form is generally ⟮the ＿unmarked＿ one⟯.

### !in languages I speak

⟮English⟯, ⟮c_;German⟯ and ⟮c_;Spanish⟯ have ⟮＿amount number＿⟯ distinguishing ⟮＿singular/plural＿⟯.
⟮Japanese⟯ ⟮does not have⟯ ⟮＿grammatical number＿⟯.

## case

»⟮Grammatical case⟯« is ⟮＿a phi-feature＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿semantic relationship＿⟯ and/or ⟮＿argument relationships＿⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical case＿⟯ is (typically, see below) encoded ⟮＿morphologically＿⟯.
⟮Some definitions of⟯ ⟮＿grammatical case＿⟯ allow for esp. ⟮c+;s-;＿argument grammatical case＿⟯ to be encoded via ⟮word order/syntax⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical case＿⟯ may be ⟮＿semantic grammatical case＿⟯ or ⟮＿argument grammatical case＿⟯.
»⟮Argument grammatical case⟯« is ⟮＿grammatical case＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿argument relationships＿⟯.
^and thus which exist depend on the morphosyntactic alignment of the language.

### semantic grammatical case

»⟮Semantic grammatical case⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿grammatical case＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿semantic relationships＿⟯.
⟮Various possible case ＿grams＿⟯ can ⟮overlap⟯, since ⟮most languages only realize a handful of them per language as ＿grammemes＿⟯.

#### movement

table:case|semantic relationship
»⟮lative⟯«|⟮to⟯
»⟮ablative⟯«|⟮away from⟯
»⟮illative⟯«|⟮into⟯
»⟮elative⟯«|⟮out of⟯
»⟮inelative⟯«|⟮from inside⟯
»⟮egressive⟯«|⟮starting from⟯
»⟮prolative⟯«/»⟮vialis⟯«/»⟮prosecutive⟯«/»⟮traversal⟯«/»⟮mediative⟯«|⟮by way of, via⟯
»⟮perlative⟯«|⟮through, across, along⟯

#### location

»⟮locative⟯«|⟮location⟯
»⟮inessive⟯«|⟮within⟯
»⟮superessive⟯«|⟮on top of, on the surface of⟯
»⟮subessive⟯«|⟮below⟯

»⟮intrative⟯«|⟮amidst⟯

»⟮genitive⟯«|⟮posess⁑or⁑⟯
»⟮abessive⟯«/»⟮caritive⟯«/»⟮privative⟯«|⟮absence of the thing⟯
