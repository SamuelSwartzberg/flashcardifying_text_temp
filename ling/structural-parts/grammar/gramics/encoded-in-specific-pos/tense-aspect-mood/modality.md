# modality

»⟮modality⟯« is ⟮＿the sm grammic fcategory＿⟯ encoding ⟮possible situations⟯. 
»⟮Mood⟯« is ⟮＿modality＿⟯ ⟮marked on a verb/VP⟯, however ⟮some authors also treat them as synonyms⟯.
⟮Different forms of⟯ ⟮＿modality＿⟯ are ⟮sometimes called flavors⟯.

### deontic/epistemic, realis/irrealis

⟮＿Modalities＿⟯ are ⟮c_;primarily categorized⟯ with two binaries: ⟮＿deontic/epistemic＿⟯ and ⟮＿realis/irreals＿⟯
»⟮Deontic modalities⟯« are ＿modalities＿ concerned with ⟮how the world ought to be⟯.
»⟮Epistemic modality⟯« are ＿modalities＿ concerned with ⟮knowledge/belief/credence⟯.
»⟮Realis modalities⟯« are ＿modalities＿ that indicate that ⟮something is the case⟯.
»⟮Irrealis modalities⟯« are ＿modalities＿ that indicate that ⟮something is somehow not the case⟯.
⟮Some ＿modalities＿⟯ are ⟮ambiguous between⟯ being ⟮＿realis/irrealis＿ and/or ＿deontic/epistemic＿⟯.
The distinction between different types of modality may not always be ⟮clear-cut⟯.


### realis epistemic

⟮Most (but not all)⟯ languoids have ⟮a single⟯ ⟮＿realis modality＿⟯ called ⟮＿the indicative modality＿⟯.

Possible ⟮＿epistemic realis modalitites＿⟯ ⟮besides the indicative⟯ are ⟮＿energetic＿⟯ or ⟮the various ＿evidential modalites＿⟯.
»⟮the energetic modality⟯« is an ⟮＿epistemic realis＿⟯ ＿modality＿ indicating ⟮emphasis or strong belief⟯.

#### evidentiality

»⟮Evidentiality (wide sense)⟯« is ⟮＿the sm grammic fcategory＿⟯ encoding ⟮what kind of evidence there is for a given statement⟯.
⟮＿Evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ is most commonly analyzed as a ⟮＿realis epistemic＿⟯ ⟮＿modiality＿⟯.
⟮Evidential⟯ =syn= ⟮verificational⟯ =syn= ⟮validational⟯
»⟮An evidential⟯« is ⟮＿a grammeme＿⟯ that encodes ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯.

⟮The most common typology⟯ of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ was mainly created by ⟮Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004, 2006)⟯.
There are two kinds of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯: ⟮＿indirectivity＿⟯ and ⟮＿evidentiality proper＿⟯.
⟮＿Indirectivity＿⟯ is sometimes called »⟮type I evidentiality⟯«, ⟮c-;＿evidentiality proper＿⟯ »⟮type II evidentiality⟯«.
⟮＿Indirectivity＿⟯ is ⟮＿the sm grammic feature＿⟯ of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ that encodes ⟮whether evidence exists, but not what kind⟯.
⟮＿Evidentiality proper＿⟯ is ⟮＿the sm grammic fcategory＿⟯ of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ that encodes ⟮what kind of evidence exists⟯.

##### evidentiality proper

⟮＿The sm grammic features＿⟯ making up ＿the sm grammic feature cateogory＿ ⟮＿evidentiality proper＿⟯ are ⟮[+/- witness]⟯, ⟮[+/- firsthand/secondhand/thirdhand]⟯, ⟮[+/- sensory]⟯, ⟮[+/- inferential]⟯, ⟮[+/- reportative]⟯, ⟮[+/- assumed]⟯.
Most languages (that have it) build ⟮＿evidentials proper＿⟯ ⟮＿grammemes＿⟯ from ⟮a combination of⟯ ⟮the various ＿sm grammic features＿⟯ of ⟮c_-3;＿evidentiality proper＿⟯.
The ＿evidentiality proper＿ ＿sm grammatical ffeature＿ ⟮[+/- sensory]⟯ may sometimes contain subfeatures ⟮[+/- visual]⟯ and/or ⟮[+/- auditory]⟯
The ＿evidentiality proper＿ ＿sm grammatical ffeature＿ ⟮[+/- reportative]⟯ may sometimes contain subfeatures ⟮[+/- hearsay]⟯ and/or ⟮[+/- quotative]⟯

### irrealis epistemic

The common ⟮＿epistemic irrealis＿⟯ ＿modalities＿ are ⟮＿subjunctive＿⟯, ⟮＿potential＿⟯, ⟮＿dubitative＿⟯, ⟮＿speculative＿⟯, ⟮＿hypothetical＿⟯, ⟮＿assumptive＿⟯

»⟮dubitative⟯«|⟮dubious/doubtful or uncertain⟯
»⟮subjunctive⟯«|⟮unlikely⟯ (generally used in ⟮subordinate clauses⟯)
»⟮speculative⟯«|⟮mere speculation⟯
»⟮hypothetical⟯«|⟮while something did not happen, it could have happened⟯
»⟮assumptive⟯«|⟮something is true because it is usually true in similar circumstances⟯ (could be realis too imo)
»⟮conditional⟯«|⟮dependent on another thing⟯


The ⟮＿tentative mood＿⟯ is more commonly called ⟮potential⟯, but this ⟮is a different meaning⟯ than the ⟮c_-;potential⟯ in ⟮japanese⟯ 

### deontic
