## syntactic

### terminology

#### independent & dependent

»⟮A independent clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ that ⟮could be a sentence on its own⟯.
»⟮A dependent clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ that ⟮could not be a sentence on its own⟯.
⟮All⟯ dependent clauses ⟮c_;are⟯ subordinate clauses, ⟮c_;but not the reverse⟯.

#### subordinate & superordinate

⟮＿A clause＿⟯ is ⟮＿contained＿⟯ in ⟮c_-;another ＿clause＿⟯ if ⟮it is part of it⟯.
»⟮A subordinate clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ which is ⟮＿contained in＿⟯ and thus ⟮in a relationship of ＿subordination＿ with⟯ ⟮another ＿clause＿⟯.
»⟮A superordinate clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ ⟮containing a given ＿subordinate clause＿⟯.
»⟮The main clause⟯« is ⟮the part of ＿the superordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮is not ＿the subordinate clause＿⟯.
!^this is a rare definition, but a useful one, and endorsed by Martin Haspelmath

#### embedded & matrix

»⟮An embedded clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮is surrounded by its ＿subordinate clause＿⟯.
^ergo one that isn't at the beginning or end of the sentence.
»⟮A matrix clause⟯« is ⟮＿the clause＿⟯ ⟮in which ＿an embedded clause＿ is ＿contained＿⟯.

#### root

»⟮The root clause⟯« is ⟮the uppermost (tree-wise)⟯ ⟮＿clause＿⟯ ⟮c_-;in the sentence⟯.

### subordinate clauses

#### syntactic relationships

»⟮A complement clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ that ⟮is ＿a verbal argument＿⟯.

#### semantic contents

»⟮An embedded question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯.

#### both, I think

»⟮A relative clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮describes ＿the referent＿ of its head⟯.
»⟮A relative pronoun⟯« is ⟮＿a pronoun＿⟯ that ⟮introduces ＿a relative clause＿⟯.
e.g. I met a furry who was passionate.

## semantic

»⟮The semantic clausal relationship⟯« (my term) is ⟮the semantic relationship⟯ ⟮between two ＿clauses＿ (no matter if coordination or subordination)⟯.

## result: sentences

»⟮a sentence⟯« is ⟮the largest⟯ ⟮＿constituent＿⟯ and ⟮the root of⟯ ⟮all other ＿constituents＿⟯.
⟮＿A sentence＿⟯ ⟮consists of⟯ ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮＿clauses＿⟯.

### one-word

»⟮A one-word sentence⟯« is ⟮＿a sentence＿⟯ consisting of ⟮＿a sentence word＿⟯.
»⟮A sentence word⟯« is ⟮a single ＿lexemic unit＿⟯ that ⟮makes up ＿a one-word sentence＿⟯.
^No. Yessir! Ouch!

### simple/complex 

»⟮A simple sentence⟯« consists of ⟮one ＿clause＿⟯.
»⟮A complex sentence⟯« consists of ⟮more than one ＿clause＿⟯.

### major/minor

»⟮A major sentence⟯« is a ＿sentence＿ which ⟮we might consider a 'normal sentence' following the usual syntactic rules etc⟯.
»⟮A minor sentence⟯« is a ＿sentence＿ ⟮without the usual subject-predicate structure⟯.
⟮＿Minor sentences＿⟯ are generally quite ⟮＿phrasemic＿⟯.

### transformation

#### cleft sentence

»⟮A cleft sentence⟯« ⟮splits⟯ ⟮＿a simple sentence＿⟯ ⟮c-;up into⟯ ⟮＿a complex sentence＿⟯. 
⟮＿A cleft sentence＿⟯ typically puts ⟮＿the constituent＿ now in ＿the main clause＿⟯ into ⟮＿focus＿⟯.
