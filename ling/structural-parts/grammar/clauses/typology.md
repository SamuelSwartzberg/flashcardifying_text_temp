## pragmatic effect

### interrogative

»⟮An interrogative clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ with ⟮＿the pragmatic effect＿⟯ of ⟮＿a question＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogative clauses＿⟯ ⟮are created⟯ using a variety of devices: ⟮＿inflection＿⟯, ⟮word order/syntactic changes⟯, ⟮addition of ＿constituent(s)＿ or ＿lexemic unit(s)＿⟯, ⟮＿phonotactic＿ changes⟯ or a combination.
Often, ⟮＿interrogative clauses＿⟯ are indicated ⟮＿graphemically＿⟯ via ⟮special ＿punctuation＿⟯. 

#### interrogatives

⟮Interrogative word⟯ =syn= ⟮interrogative⟯
»⟮An interrogative⟯« is ⟮＿a lexemic unit＿⟯ used ⟮in creating ＿an interrogative clause＿⟯.
»⟮An interrogative particle⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a particle＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogatives＿⟯ may be instantiated by ⟮different ＿parts of speech＿⟯.

#### question (here instead of in → pragmatics for now)

»⟮A question⟯« is a kind of ⟮＿pragmatic effect＿⟯.
⟮＿A question＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a polar question＿⟯, ⟮＿an alternative question＿⟯, or ⟮＿an open question＿⟯.
»⟮A polar question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a  or negation.
»⟮An alternative question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a choice of given alternatives, or a negation.
»⟮An open question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which allows for any number of possible answers (including a negation).

##### polar question

»⟮The polar question polarity⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the polarity＿ of ＿the polar question＿⟯ itself, which ⟮changes ＿the polarity of the presumed response＿⟯.
»⟮The polarity of the presumed response⟯« (my term) is ⟮which⟯ ⟮＿truth/falsity polarity＿⟯ ⟮c_-;of the response⟯ ⟮counts as confirmation/negation of the question⟯.
Languoids may have ⟮either two, three or four⟯ types of ⟮＿polarics＿⟯ that ⟮answer ＿polar questions＿⟯.
If a languoid has ⟮2/4⟯ ⟮types of ＿polarics＿ to answer polar questions⟯, these ⟮do not/do⟯ ⟮distinguish between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation⟯.
A languoid with ⟮3⟯ ⟮types of ＿polarics＿ to answer polar questions⟯ ⟮distinguishes between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation⟯ ⟮only when answering negative polar questions (the hard case)⟯.
A language I speak with ⟮3⟯ types of ＿polarics＿ to answer polar questions is ⟮German⟯.

#### creation

##### adding constituents

###### tag questsions

»⟮A tag question⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative clause＿⟯ which is formed from ⟮＿a declarative clause＿⟯ plus ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯.
⟮＿Tag questions＿⟯ express ⟮＿polar questions＿⟯.
»⟮A question tag⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ required for ⟮creating ＿a tag question＿⟯.
⟮＿A question tag＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a question tag simple lexemic unit＿⟯, or ⟮＿a question tag complex constituent＿⟯.
»⟮a question tag simple lexemic unit⟯« is ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯ which is ⟮a single ＿lexemic unit＿⟯.
»⟮a question tag complex constituent⟯« is ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯ which is ⟮＿a constituent＿ with more complex internal structure⟯.
In ⟮＿a tag question＿⟯, ⟮both ＿the declarative clause＿ and ＿the question tag＿⟯ ⟮can (possibly) have ＿positive/negative polarity＿⟯.
The ⟮four (2*2)⟯ ⟮possible ＿polarity＿ combinations⟯ in ＿a tag question＿ may create ⟮various combinations of⟯ ⟮＿polarity of the expected answer＿⟯ and ⟮＿pragmatic effects＿⟯.
Most languages have ⟮multiple different⟯ question tags.
