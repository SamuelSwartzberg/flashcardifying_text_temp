# lexemic semantics

## semantic relations

⟮lexical relation⟯ = ⟮semantic relation⟯.
»⟮A semantic relation⟯« is ⟮the relationship between⟯ ⟮＿the sememes＿⟯ ⟮expressed by different ＿lexemes＿⟯.
»⟮*nyms⟯« are typically ⟮types of ＿lexical units＿⟯ whose ⟮＿sememes＿⟯ ⟮have certain properties⟯
//todo: lexemes can express multiple sememes as detailed below, which is necessary for the semantic relationships expressed above. But what do we call these things (expressed sememe, conventional sememe, etc.)

### same/opposite meaning (and related concepts)

table:name|meaning|pronunciation/spelling
»⟮synonyms⟯«|⟮same⟯|⟮different⟯
»⟮antonym⟯« (⟮wide⟯)|⟮opposite⟯|⟮?⟯
»⟮antonym⟯« (⟮narrow⟯)|⟮opposite⟯|⟮different⟯
»⟮auto-antonym⟯«|⟮opposite⟯|⟮same⟯
»⟮polyseme⟯«|⟮different but related⟯|⟮same⟯
»⟮homonym⟯«|⟮different⟯|⟮same⟯

#### homonyms

⟮＿A homonym＿⟯ in the ⟮strong⟯ sense ⟮requires⟯ ⟮both pronunciation and spelling⟯ ⟮c_-;to be the same⟯.
⟮＿A homonym＿⟯ in the ⟮strong⟯ sense is ⟮both a ＿homophone＿ and ＿homograph＿⟯ in the ⟮weak⟯ sense.
⟮＿A homonym＿⟯ in the ⟮weak⟯ sense ⟮requires⟯ ⟮at least one of pronunciation or spelling⟯ ⟮c_-;to be the same⟯.
⟮＿A homonym＿⟯ in the ⟮weak⟯ sense may be a ⟮＿homophone＿ or ＿homograph＿⟯, or ⟮both⟯, if ⟮we're using the weak version of these terms⟯.
Both ＿homograph＿ and ＿homophone＿ have ⟮a weak version⟯, where ⟮＿homographs/phones＿⟯ ⟮may be⟯ ⟮pronounced/spelled differently⟯, and ⟮c-3;a strong version⟯, where ⟮＿homographs/phones＿⟯ ⟮must be⟯ ⟮pronounced/spelled differently⟯.
»⟮A homograph⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ that ⟮means something different⟯ but ⟮is spelled the same⟯, it ⟮may (weak) or must (strong)⟯ be ⟮pronounced differently⟯.
»⟮A heterophone⟯« is ⟮＿a homograph＿⟯ in ⟮the strong sense⟯.
Confusingly, ⟮＿heterophones＿⟯ are also sometimes called ⟮heteronyms⟯.
»⟮A homophone⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ that ⟮means something different⟯ but ⟮is pronounced the same⟯, it ⟮may (weak) or must (strong)⟯ be ⟮spelled differently⟯.
»⟮A heterograph⟯« is ⟮＿a homophone＿⟯ in ⟮the strong sense⟯.

#### senses

»⟮A sense⟯« of ⟮a lexeme⟯ is ⟮one of the ＿sememes＿⟯ ⟮it is associated with⟯.
⟮＿Senses＿⟯ of lexemes are always ⟮related⟯.
If one encounters ⟮two ＿senses＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿lexeme＿⟯ that are ⟮unrelated⟯, there are actually two ⟮different ＿lexemes＿⟯ which are ⟮＿homonyms＿⟯.
»⟮Polysemy⟯« is the property of ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ of ⟮having multiple ＿senses＿⟯.

### sub/superset

»⟮A hyponym⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ whose ⟮＿sememe＿'s associated set⟯ is ⟮a subset of⟯ ⟮the set associated with the ＿sememe＿⟯ of »⟮its hypernym⟯«.
“Musical instrument” is a ⟮＿hypernym＿⟯ of “guitar” because a guitar is a musical instrument.
»⟮An autohyponym⟯« is ⟮＿a hyponym＿⟯ that is ⟮the same ＿lexical unit＿⟯ as ⟮c_-;＿its hypernym＿⟯.
»⟮a cover term⟯« is ⟮＿a hypernym＿⟯ for ⟮a specific set of lexical units⟯ ⟮created for that purpose⟯.
⟮＿A hypernym＿⟯ may also be called ⟮an umbrella term⟯ or ⟮a blanket term⟯.

### part/whole

A »⟮meronym⟯«'s ⟮＿sememe＿⟯ semantically ⟮is a part of⟯ a »⟮holonym⟯«'s ⟮c_-2;＿sememe＿⟯.
seatbelt is a ⟮＿meronym＿⟯ of (e.g.) car which is its ⟮c-;＿holonym＿⟯.
»⟮A gestalt⟯« is ⟮＿a holonym＿⟯ that ⟮can't be adequately explained by listing its ＿meronyms＿⟯.

### indirect

#### metonym

»⟮A metonym⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ where ⟮the 「expressed sememe」⟯ is one c⟮losely associated with⟯ ⟮the sememe that is the conventional meaning of the word⟯ (「⟮conventional sememe⟯」).
»⟮Synechdoche⟯« is a type of ⟮＿metonym＿⟯ where the ⟮＿expressed sememe＿ and ＿conventional sememe＿⟯ have a ⟮part ↔ whole⟯ relationship.
»⟮Pars pro toto⟯« is a type of ⟮＿synechodoche＿⟯ where ⟮＿the conventional sememe＿⟯ is a ⟮part⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the expressed sememe＿⟯ is a ⟮whole⟯.
»⟮totum pro parte⟯« is a type of ⟮＿synechodoche＿⟯ where ⟮＿the conventional sememe＿⟯ is a ⟮whole⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the expressed sememe＿⟯ is a ⟮part⟯.
Individual body parts are often used to refer to an entire body, constituting ⟮＿a pars pro toto＿⟯: "skin" or "hide" ("save your skin" or "skin in the game" or "the teacher will have my hide"), "mouth" ("mouth to feed"), "head" ("head count")
An example for ⟮＿a totum pro parte＿⟯ is the word America for the United States.
