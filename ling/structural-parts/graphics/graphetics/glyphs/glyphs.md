# glyphs

Glyphs may be divided into single glyphs and combination glyphs. (though the boundaries are fuzzy)
Single glyphs are glyphs that are somehow fundamental.
Combination glyphs are glyphs that are somehow composite.
Single glyphs may roughly be divided into ⟮＿simple encoding glyphs＿⟯ and ⟮＿non-simple encoding glyphs＿⟯.
