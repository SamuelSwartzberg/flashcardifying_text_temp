»⟮A simple encoding glyph⟯« (my term) is a glyph that (most of the time) has ⟮a single⟯ ⟮＿graphemically encoded item＿⟯.
the two types of ⟮＿simple encoding glyph＿⟯ are ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ and ⟮＿phonograms＿⟯
»⟮a logogram ⟯«is ⟮＿a simple encoding glyph＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿a morphemelike segment＿⟯
»⟮a phonogram⟯« is ⟮＿a simple encoding glyph＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿a sound linguistic unit＿⟯

»⟮Compound logograms⟯« are ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ consisting of ⟮multiple ＿component radicals＿⟯.
»⟮Non-compound logograms⟯« are ⟮＿logograms＿⟯ consisting of ⟮no other logograms⟯.

#### non-compound logograms

⟮＿Non-compound logograms＿⟯ may be ⟮＿pictograms＿⟯, ⟮＿ideograms＿⟯ or ⟮＿phonetic logograms＿⟯.

##### picto∨ideograms

»⟮A picto∨ideogram⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a pictogram＿ or ＿an ideogram＿⟯.
»⟮A pictogram⟯« is ⟮＿a non-compound logogram＿⟯ which ⟮depicts the thing⟯ it ⟮references⟯, or ⟮once did⟯.
^Examples of pictogram kanji: 日, 月, 山, 木, 口 etc.
»⟮An ideogram⟯« is ⟮＿a non-compound logogram＿⟯ which ⟮attempts to visualize⟯ ⟮the abstract concept⟯ it ⟮c_;represents⟯.

##### composition

»⟮The dictionary radical⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the component radical＿⟯ used for ⟮indexing in the dictionary⟯.
»⟮A determinative⟯« is ⟮＿a picto∨ideogram＿⟯ which is ⟮used as ＿a component radical＿⟯ and thus ⟮marks the semantic category⟯ of ⟮c_-;＿the compound logogram＿⟯. 
»⟮A phonetic radical⟯« is ⟮＿a phonetic logogram＿⟯ which is ⟮used as ＿a component radical＿⟯ and thus ⟮determines the pronunciation⟯ of ⟮c_-;＿the compound logogram＿⟯.
^sometimes the pronunciation of compounds may differ somewhat

##### compound types

»⟮A phono-semantic compound⟯« is ⟮＿a compound logogram＿⟯ made up of ⟮one or more ＿determinative(s)＿⟯ and ⟮one or more ＿phonetic radical(s)＿⟯.
»⟮A semantic-semantic compound⟯« is ⟮＿a compound logogram＿⟯ made up of ⟮two or more ＿determinative(s)＿⟯.

#### processes beyond compounding

»⟮A rebus logogram⟯« is a logogram that is used for ⟮an unrelated but similarly-pronounced⟯ ⟮＿morphemelike segment＿⟯.
»⟮A calcified rebus logogram⟯« (my term) is a rebus logogram that ⟮has lost its association with the original ＿morphemelike segment＿⟯.

#### logosyllabary, logoconsonantal

A logographic writing system is »⟮logosyllabic⟯« if ⟮＿phonetic logograms＿⟯ are ⟮＿syllables＿⟯ and are ⟮commonly used⟯.
A logographic writing system is »⟮logoconsonantal⟯« if ⟮＿phonetic logograms＿⟯ are ⟮＿consonants＿⟯ and are ⟮commonly used⟯.

## phonograms

⟮＿phonograms＿⟯ are divided into ⟮＿multiphonogram＿⟯, ⟮＿letters＿⟯ and ⟮＿abjad characters＿⟯.

### multiphonograms

Common types of ⟮＿multiphonogram＿⟯ are ⟮＿syllabograms＿⟯ and ⟮＿abugidograms＿⟯. 

#### syllabogram

»⟮A syllabogram⟯« is ⟮＿a multiphonogram＿⟯ that (ideally) ⟮represents a syllable or mora⟯.
A »⟮syllabary⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ that consists of ⟮＿syllabograms＿⟯.

#### abugidogram

»⟮An abugidogram⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a multiphonogram＿⟯ which ⟮represents ＿a consonant＿⟯, and ⟮c_;vowels⟯ are ⟮added as modifications of the base character⟯.

### abjad characters

»⟮An abjad character⟯« is ⟮＿a phonogram＿⟯ of ⟮＿an abjad＿⟯.
An »⟮abjad⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ which ⟮primarily deals in consonants⟯.
A »⟮pure abjad⟯« has ⟮no way of indicating vowels whatsoever⟯.
An »⟮impure abjad⟯« has ⟮some way of indicating vowels⟯.
An ⟮＿impure abjad＿⟯ may ⟮indicate vowels⟯ with ⟮diacritics⟯ or ⟮a limited set of vowel letters⟯.

### letters
