# graphic features

## basics

### fonts and font families

⟮typeface⟯ =syn= ⟮font family⟯. 
»⟮A font⟯« is ⟮a ＿typeface＿⟯ ⟮with certain values for the font-varied fcategories⟯. 
A font-varied feature is a graphic fcategory where changing the values changes the font, but not the typeface or the grapheme.
A typeface-varied feature is a graphic feature where changing the values changes the typeface, but not the font or the grapheme.
Graphemically-varied feature = distinctive graphic feature
The font-varied features are mainly font weight, font size and slope.
Ergo, there are ⟮many ＿fonts＿⟯ of ⟮a given ＿typeface＿.⟯ 
Properties that are ⟮varied⟯ to ⟮produce different ＿fonts＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿typeface＿⟯ are most commonly ⟮＿weight＿⟯, ⟮size⟯, and ⟮slope⟯, though ⟮other things can also be varied⟯. 

### typeface

»⟮A typeface letterform⟯« (my term) is an alternant of ⟮＿a glyph＿⟯ with certain typeface features.
A typeface feature is a graphic feature where varying it changes the typeface letterform and thus the typeface.
A typeface is an instantiation of a glyph set ith certain typeface features.
Alternatively, a typeface is a set of typeface letterforms with the same typeface features.

### type, sort

flex-container:✫metal-movable-type.jpg✫


»⟮A type⎵countable⎵⟯ «is ⟮a block⟯ ⟮with a glyph on it⟯ used ⟮for printing⟯.
»⟮Type⎵uncountable⎵⟯« is ⟮types collectively⟯.
⟮A type⎵countable⎵⟯ may thus also be called ⟮a piece/block of type⟯.
In most printing processes, ⟮type⟯ was made of ⟮metal⟯.
»⟮A sort⟯« is ⟮a type⟯ for ⟮a single character with certain characteristics (weight, size, etc.)⟯.
⟮type⟯ and ⟮sort⟯ only apply to ⟮movable type⟯.

## distinctive graphic features

### letter case

»⟮Letter case⟯« is the graphic fcategory of types distinguished mainly by size.
Typical values for letter case in a 2-cameral system = uppercase, lowercase
⟮uppercase grapheme⟯ =syn= ⟮captial letter⟯ =syn= ⟮majuscle⟯ 
⟮lowercase grapheme⟯ =syn= ⟮minuscle⟯  

### type anatomy

flex-container:✫type-anatomy.svg✫✫descender.png✫✫long-ascenders.jpg✫
Type anatomy is the composition of glyphs.

#### body

»⟮the body height⟯« is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the ＿ascender＿ and ＿descender line＿⟯. 
The ⟮＿body height＿⟯ when talking about ⟮movable type⟯ is ⟮the height of the sort⟯. 

#### baseline, mean line

The »⟮baseline⟯« is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮on which most letters sit⟯.
The »⟮mean line⟯« is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮up to which most lowercase letters extend⟯.

#### x-height

⟮x-height⟯ = ⟮corpus size⟯
The »⟮x-height⟯« is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮＿baseline＿ and ＿mean line＿⟯.
⟮the height of the x-height⟯ typically ⟮corresponds to the height of the x⟯, ⟮hence the name⟯. 

#### overshoot

»⟮Overshoot⟯« is when letters ⟮extend a little⟯ ⟮above or below⟯ ⟮the lines meant to constrain them⟯.
If downwards, ⟮＿overshoot＿⟯ is extending beyond the ⟮＿baseline＿⟯.
If upwards, ⟮＿overshoot＿⟯ is extending beyond the ⟮＿x-height＿ or ＿cap height＿⟯.
⟮＿Overshoot＿⟯ is used due to ⟮quirks with our perception⟯, where otherwise ⟮the non-overshot letters would look slightly too small⟯.
⟮＿Overshoot＿⟯ is generally used for ⟮round⟯ or ⟮c_;pointy⟯ leters.

#### ascenders, descenders, line spacing

A »⟮descender⟯« is ⟮the portion of a letter⟯ which ⟮extends below the ＿baseline＿⟯. 
Letters such as ⟮lowercase y, g, and j⟯ typically have ⟮＿descenders＿⟯. 
»⟮the descender depth⟯« is the ⟮distance⟯ ⟮the ＿descender＿ reaches below the ＿baseline＿⟯ 
A »⟮ascender⟯« is ⟮the portion of a letter⟯ which ⟮extends above the ＿baseline＿⟯. 
Letters such as ⟮lowercase f, h and uppercase letters (if we want to count them⟯) typically have ⟮＿ascenders＿⟯. 
The »⟮ascender height⟯« is the ⟮distance⟯ that ⟮＿ascenders＿ reach above the ＿baseline＿⟯. 
The ⟮＿ascender height＿⟯ is generally ⟮higher than⟯ ⟮the ＿cap-height＿⟯ 
⟮ascender line⟯ = ⟮topline⟯
The »⟮ascender/descender line⟯« is ⟮the imaginary line⟯ ⟮defined by⟯ ⟮the ＿ascender height/descender depth＿⟯ 
⟮Line spacing⟯ = ⟮leading⟯
»⟮Line spacing⟯« is ⟮the distance between⟯ ⟮the ＿descender line＿⟯ and ⟮the next ＿ascender line＿⟯ 

#### super/subscript

⟮＿Subscript＿ and ＿superscipt＿⟯ text is usually ⟮smaller than⟯ regular text. 
»⟮Superscript⟯« text is text whose ⟮＿baseline＿⟯ ⟮sits somewhat above⟯ ⟮c-;the general ＿baseline＿⟯. 
»⟮Subscript⟯« text may ⟮sit at the general ＿baseline＿⟯ and ⟮just be smaller⟯ or ⟮have a ＿baseline＿⟯ ⟮somewhat below⟯ ⟮c-;the general ＿baseline＿⟯.


## font-varied features

### weight

font weight is a sm graphic fcategory controlling the relative thickness of the characters.

#### 1k weight scale

The 1k weight scale (my term) is the scale specifying values for the graphic fcategory font weight in values between 1-1000.
The 1k weight scale may be the fixed-weight scale or the variable-weight scale.

##### fixed-weight scale

The fixed-weight scale is the 1k weight scale that allows values from 100 to 900 in steps of 50 or 100.

##### variable-weight scale

the variable-weight scale is the 1k weight scale that allows values from 1 to 1000 in steps of 1.

#### keyword values

The weight keywords are a set of keywords that are used as fvalues for the graphic fcategory weight.

##### correspondence with weight scale

table:1k weight scale|keyword values
100|thin/hairline
200|ultra/extra light
300|light
400|regular
500|medium
600|semi/demi bold
700|bold
800|ultra/extra bold
900|black

### keming ＆ letter-spacing

flex-container:✫kerning-av.jpg✫✫metal-type-kerning.png✫

Intraletter whitespace distance (my term) is a sm/ssm graphic fcategory specifying the distance of the horizontal distance between glyphs.

#### letter-spacing

Letter-spacing is intraletter whitespace distance equally between all glyphs in a glyph sequence.
⟮Letter-spacing⟯ =syn= ⟮tracking⟯

#### kerning

Kerning is intraletter whitespace distance equally between all glyphs in a glyph sequence (only in a proportional/variable width typeface).
⟮＿kerning＿⟯ generally involves ⟮intruding into⟯ ⟮the box of another glyph's sort⟯. 
Original, the »⟮kern⟯« of ⟮a glyph or its sort⟯ was ⟮the part that overhangs its sort⟯. 
Default kerning (my term) is the kerning that is applied in almost all typefaces in existence to ensure nice visual distance.

#### monospace

A monospaced font where all characters occupy the same horizontal space.
A font that is not monospaced is proportional-width

### font size

The »⟮font size⟯« specifies the ⟮＿body height＿⟯. 
Thus, if using ⟮movable type⟯, ⟮the ＿font size＿⟯ specifes ⟮the physical height of the ＿sort＿.⟯ 
Thus, if using ⟮digital type⟯, ⟮＿font size＿⟯ is ⟮the height that the ＿em square＿ is scaled to⟯. 
Stated differently, in ⟮digital type⟯, ⟮setting a specific ＿font size＿⟯ ⟮scales up the ＿em square＿⟯. 
⟮The ＿font size＿⟯ is called ⟮「point size」⟯ if ⟮specified in point⟯, or ⟮sometimes also if not⟯. 
»⟮em⟯« is a unit ⟮relative to⟯ ⟮the current ＿font size＿⟯.
Ergo, the ⟮＿font size＿⟯ is equal to ⟮1em (by definition)⟯.
Following the general definition of the font size, in css ⟮the em⟯ is ⟮equivalent to⟯ ⟮the current font-size.⟯ 

#### units

##### ems and ens

flex-container:✫m-vs-em.svg✫


⟮the sort⟯ of ⟮uppercase Ms⟯ used to be ⟮as wide as tall (i.e. square)⟯,
⟮em⟯ is sometimes also defined as ⟮the width⟯ of an ⟮uppercase (or more rarely lowercase)⟯ ⟮M⟯.
Defining an em as ⟮the width of an uppercase m⟯ is ⟮equivalent to⟯ ⟮the usual definition⟯ since ⟮the sort of uppercase Ms used to be square.⟯
!The »⟮en⟯« is either
- !⟮half the width⟯ of ⟮an em⟯. 
- !⟮the width⟯ of ⟮an uppercase or lowercase⟯ ⟮n⟯. 
The »⟮en/em space/dash⟯« are ⟮a space and dash⟯ that are defined as ⟮one en/em⟯ ⟮wide⟯.
The ⟮en/em space⟯ and ⟮c_;en/em dash⟯ are ⟮one en/em⟯ ⟮wide⟯. 
Due to ⟮the confusion about definitions of en/ems⟯, sometimes ⟮variant definitions⟯ for ⟮en/em dashes/spaces⟯ are used. 

##### point

In typography, the »⟮point⟯« is ⟮the smallest⟯ ⟮unit of measure⟯. 
⟮the exact size⟯ of ⟮the ＿point＿⟯ ⟮has varied⟯.
⟮＿point＿⟯ is often abbreviated ⟮pt⟯ or ⟮c_;just p⟯. 
»⟮A pica⟯« is ⟮12 point (whatever point you're using)⟯.

###### DTP point

⟮DTP point⟯ = ⟮DeskTop Publishing point⟯.
the ⟮＿DTP point＿⟯ ⟮came into existence⟯ ⟮with digital printing⟯.
The ⟮＿DTP point＿⟯ has become a sort of ⟮standard ＿point＿⟯.
the »⟮DTP point⟯« is defined as ⟮1/72 inch⟯.
If using ⟮the ＿DTP point＿⟯, ⟮＿a pica＿⟯ is ⟮1/6 inch⟯.

###### css

⟮CSS⟯ uses ⟮the DTP⟯ ⟮＿point＿⟯.
In ⟮CSS⟯, ⟮`pt`⟯ is the unit name for ⟮＿point＿⟯.
In ⟮CSS⟯, ⟮`pc`⟯ is the unit name for ⟮＿pica＿⟯.

###### tex

⟮TeX's⟯ ⟮bp⟯ is ⟮equivalent to the DTP point⟯.
⟮TeX's⟯ ⟮pt⟯ is ⟮very slightly smaller than the DTP point⟯. 

#### em square ＆ relative sizing

flex-container:✫metal-movable-type.jpg✫


The »⟮em square⟯« is ⟮an imaginary square⟯ ⟮around which parts of letters are sized⟯.
The ⟮＿em square＿⟯ is used in ⟮digital typography⟯.
The ⟮＿em square＿⟯ is ⟮1em⟯ ⟮wide and high⟯.
Using ⟮＿the em sqare＿⟯ allows us to ⟮give the size⟯ of ⟮any other part of the font (e.g. ascender height, x-height, cap height, etc. etc.)⟯ ⟮in em⟯.
The size relationship ⟮between parts of letters⟯ ofc. depends on ⟮the typeface⟯.

##### average relative sizing

table:type property|size
⟮cap height⟯|⟮0.7em⟯
⟮x-height⟯|⟮0.5em⟯
