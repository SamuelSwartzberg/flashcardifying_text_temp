»⟮synonym⎵general⎵⟯«|⟮same⟯|⟮different⟯
»⟮homonym⎵general⎵⟯«|⟮different⟯|⟮same⟯

#### synonym

»⟮A synonym⎵general⎵⟯« may be ⟮＿a synonym⎵weak⎵＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a synonym⎵strong⎵＿⟯.
»⟮A synonym⎵strong/weak⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a synonym⎵general⎵＿⟯ where ⟮both/at least one⟯ of ⟮the pronunciation and the spelling⟯ must be ⟮different⟯.

#### homonyms

»⟮A homonym⎵general⎵⟯« may be ⟮＿a homonym⎵weak⎵＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a homonym⎵strong⎵＿⟯.
»⟮A homonym⎵strong/weak⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a homonym⎵general⎵＿⟯ where ⟮both/at least one⟯ of ⟮the pronunciation and the spelling⟯ must be ⟮the same⟯.
⟮＿homonym⎵strong⎵＿⟯ = ⟮＿homophone⎵weak⎵＿⟯ ⟮∧⟯ ⟮＿homograph⎵weak⎵＿⟯.
⟮＿homonym⎵weak⎵＿⟯ = ⟮＿homophone⎵strong⎵＿⟯ ⟮⊕⟯ ⟮＿homograph⎵strong⎵＿⟯.

##### homograph/homophone

»⟮A homograph⎵general⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a homonym⎵general⎵＿⟯ where ⟮the spelling⟯ is ⟮the same⟯.
»⟮A homograph⎵strong/weak⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a homograph⎵general⎵＿⟯ where ⟮the pronunciation⟯ ⟮must/may be⟯ different.
»⟮A homophone⎵general⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a homonym⎵general⎵＿⟯ where ⟮the pronunciation⟯ is ⟮the same⟯.
»⟮A homophone⎵strong/weak⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a homophone⎵general⎵＿⟯ where ⟮the spelling⟯ ⟮must/may be⟯ ⟮different⟯.
»⟮Heterophone⟯« ≙ ⟮＿homograph⎵strong⎵＿⟯
»⟮Heterograph⟯« ≙ ⟮＿homophone⎵strong⎵＿⟯


Confusingly, ⟮＿heterophones＿⟯ are also sometimes called ⟮heteronyms⟯.

### antonym

»⟮An antonym⟯« is ⟮＿a lexemic unit l1＿⟯ with ⟮＿a sememe＿⟯ with ⟮c_;the opposite meaning⟯ to ⟮c-;＿a lexemic unit l2＿⟯'s ⟮＿sememe＿⟯.
⟮＿An antonym＿⟯ may be ⟮＿an antonym⎵distinct general⎵＿⟯ or ⟮＿an auto-antonym⎵general⎵＿⟯.
»⟮An antonym⎵distinct general⎵⟯« is an antonym where the two lexemic units do not share a pronunciation/spelling. 
»⟮An auto-antonym⎵general⎵⟯« is an antonym where the two lexemic units do not share a pronunciation/spelling. 
»⟮An antonym⎵distinct strong/weak⎵⟯« is an antonym⎵distinct general⎵ where both/at least one of the pronunication/spelling are different.
»⟮An auto-antonym⎵strong/weak⎵⟯« is an auto-antonym⎵general⎵ where both/at least one of the pronunication/spelling are the same.

### hynyms

»⟮A hynym⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a lexemic relatant＿⟯ where ⟮＿the semantic relation＿⟯ is ⟮c_;sub/superset-related⟯.
»⟮A hyponym/hypernym⟯« is ⟮＿a hynym＿⟯ where ⟮＿the semantic relation＿⟯ is ⟮c_;subset/superset⟯.
»⟮An autohyponym⟯« is ⟮＿a hyponym＿⟯ where ⟮l1 = l2⟯.
I will define ⟮⊂⎵h⎵⟯ and ⟮c_;⊃⎵h⎵⟯ as ⟮operators⟯ for ⟮hyponym⟯ and ⟮c_;hypernym⟯

#### derived terms

»⟮a cover term⟯« is ⟮＿a hypernym＿⟯ qua hypernym
⟮＿A hypernym＿⟯ may also be called ⟮an umbrella term⟯ or ⟮a blanket term⟯.

### partonyms

»⟮A partonym⟯« (my term) ⟮＿a lexemic relatant＿⟯ where ⟮＿the semantic relation＿⟯ is ⟮c_;part/whole-related⟯.
»⟮A meronym/holonym⟯« is ⟮＿a partonym＿⟯ where ⟮＿the semantic relation＿⟯ is ⟮c_;part/whole⟯.

### indirect

#### metonym

A literal sense is a sense that is properly part of the lexemic unit.
A conventional sense is a sense that becomes associated with a lexemic unit.
A metonym is a lexemic unit with a conventional sense derived from its literal sense.

##### synechdoche

»⟮A synechodoche⟯« is ⟮＿a metonym＿⟯ where the senses have a semantic relation of part/whole.
A pars pro toto/totum pro parte is a synechdoche where the literal/conventional sense is a part → whole/whole → part.
