# lexemic semantics

## senses

»⟮A sense⟯« is a sememe of a lexemic unit.
⟮＿Senses＿⟯ of an lexemic unit are always ⟮related⟯.
^otherwise: different lexemes which are homonyms.
»⟮Polysemy⟯« is the property of ⟮＿a lexeme＿⟯ of ⟮having multiple ＿senses＿⟯.

## semantic relations

»⟮A lexical relation⟯« (has polysemy) is ⟮a relationship between⟯ two lexemic units l1, l2 characterized by a semantic relation between their sememes.
A lexical relatant (my term) is a lexemic unit in a semantic relation.
A semantic relation (uncommon definition) is the relationship between two sememes.
»⟮A *nym⟯« is a ⟮＿lexemic unit＿⟯ which has a certain semantic relation with another given lexemic unit.

»⟮homonym⎵general⎵⟯«|⟮different⟯|⟮same⟯

#### synonym

A synonym⎵general⎵ may be a synonym⎵weak⎵ or a synonym⎵strong⎵.
A synonym⎵strong/weak⎵ is a synonym⎵general⎵ where both/at least one of the pronunciation and the spelling must be different.

#### homonyms

A homonym⎵general⎵ may be a homonym⎵weak⎵ or a synonym⎵strong⎵.
A homonym⎵strong/weak⎵ is a homonym⎵general⎵ where both/at least one of the pronunciation and the spelling must be the same.
⟮＿homonym⎵strong⎵＿⟯ = homophone⎵weak⎵ ∧ homograph⎵weak⎵.
⟮＿homonym⎵weak⎵＿⟯ = homophone⎵strong⎵ ⊕ homograph⎵strong⎵.

##### homograph/homophone

A homograph⎵general⎵ is a homonym⎵general⎵ where the spelling is the same.
A homograph⎵strong/weak⎵ is a homograph⎵general⎵ where the pronunciation must/may be different.
A homophone⎵general⎵ is a homonym⎵general⎵ where the pronunciation is the same.
A homophone⎵strong/weak⎵ is a homophone⎵general⎵ where the spelling must/may be different.
Heterophone ≙ homograph⎵strong⎵
Heterograph ≙ homophone⎵strong⎵


Confusingly, ⟮＿heterophones＿⟯ are also sometimes called ⟮heteronyms⟯.

### antonym

An antonym is a lexemic unit l1 with an sememe with the opposite meaning to an lexemic unit l2's sememe.
An antonymmay be an antonym⎵distinct general⎵ or an auto-antonym⎵general⎵ .
An antonym⎵distinct general⎵ is an antonym where the two lexemic units do not share a pronunciation/spelling. 
An auto-antonym⎵general⎵ is an antonym where the two lexemic units do not share a pronunciation/spelling. 
An antonym⎵distinct strong/weak⎵ is an antonym⎵distinct general⎵ where both/at least one of the pronunication/spelling are different.
An auto-antonym⎵strong/weak⎵ is an auto-antonym⎵general⎵ where both/at least one of the pronunication/spelling are the same.

### hynyms

A hynym (my term) is a lexical relatant where the semantic relation is sub/superset-related.
A hyponym is a hynym where the semantic relation is subset.
A hypernym is a hynym where the semantic relation is superset.
An autohyponym is a hyponym where l1 = l2.
I will define ⊂⎵h⎵ and ⊃⎵h⎵ as operators for hyponym and hypernym

#### derived terms

»⟮a cover term⟯« is ⟮＿a hypernym＿⟯ qua hypernym
⟮＿A hypernym＿⟯ may also be called ⟮an umbrella term⟯ or ⟮a blanket term⟯.

### partonyms

A partonym (my term) a lexical relatant where the semantic relation is part/whole-related.
A meronym is a partonym where the semantic relation is part.
A holonym is a partonym where the semantic relation is whole.

### indirect

#### metonym

A literal sense is a sense that is properly part of the lexemic unit.
A conventional sense is a sense that becomes associated with a lexemic unit.
A metonym is a lexemic unit with a conventional sense derived from its literal sense.

##### synechdoche

A synechodoche is a metonym where the senses have a semantic relation of part/whole.
A pars pro toto is a metonym where the literal/conventional sense is a part/whole.
A totum pro parte is a metonym where the literal/conventional sense is a whole/part.
