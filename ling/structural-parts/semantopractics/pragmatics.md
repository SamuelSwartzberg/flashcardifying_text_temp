# pragmatics

»⟮Pragmatics⟯« is the part of ⟮＿semantopragmatics＿⟯ that studies ⟮the meaning⟯ ⟮beyond the literal semantic meaning of lexical units/constituents⟯.

## approaches

»⟮A pragmatic theory⟯« (my term) is ⟮an analysis of pragmatics⟯.
The main ⟮＿pragmatic theories＿⟯ are ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯ and ⟮＿pragmatic act theor＿⟯y.

### speech acts (austin, searle)

»⟮Speech act theory⟯« is ⟮＿a pragmatic theory＿⟯ centered around ⟮＿speech acts＿⟯.
⟮＿Speech act theory＿⟯ was ⟮developed by⟯ ⟮JL Austin⟯ in 『⟮How to Do Things with Words⟯』 (⟮1962⟯).
⟮＿Speech act theory＿⟯ was ⟮expanded on⟯ mainly by ⟮Searle⟯.
Both ⟮＿act type＿⟯ and ⟮＿the loc/ill/perl distinction＿⟯ ⟮originate from⟯ ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯

### pragmatic acts (mey)

»⟮Pragmatic act theory⟯« is ⟮＿a pragmatic theory＿⟯ centered around ⟮＿pragmatic acts/pragmemes＿⟯.
⟮＿Pragmatic act theory＿⟯ was developed by ⟮Mey⟯ starting around ⟮2000⟯.
⟮＿Pragmatic act theory＿⟯ has become ⟮the standard sucessor theory⟯ to ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯. 

## things

»⟮The whatevertheory prag act⟯« (my term) is ⟮the main unit⟯ in ⟮＿a pragmatic theory＿⟯
⟮＿The whatevertheory prag act＿⟯ is ⟮＿a speech act＿⟯ in ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿a pragmatic act＿⟯ in ⟮＿pragmatic act theory＿⟯.
»⟮The typeable act⟯« is ⟮any element⟯ of ⟮＿a pragmatic theory＿⟯ that ⟮can have ＿an act type＿⟯.
⟮＿The typeable act＿⟯ is ⟮＿the speech act pragmatic act＿⟯ in ⟮＿speech act theory＿⟯, and ⟮c-;＿a prag＿⟯ in ⟮＿pragmatic act theory＿⟯.

### speech acts

»⟮A speech act⟯« is the sum of ⟮＿locutionary＿, ＿illocutionary＿ and ＿perlocutionary＿⟯ ⟮act⟯.
a ⟮＿locutionary, illocutionary or perlocutionary＿⟯ ⟮＿act＿⟯ has ⟮c-;＿a locutionary, illocutionary or perlocutionary＿⟯ »⟮force⟯« attached.
An act is any of locutionary, illocutionary or perlocutionary acts.
»⟮A speech act pragmatic act⟯« is any act in speech act theory that can have an act type.
⟮＿A speech act pragmatic act＿⟯ is either ⟮＿a speech act＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿illocutionary act＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿perlocutionary act＿⟯.

### pragmeme

A pragmatic act is the expr which is what one does when saying something.
»⟮A pract⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮a certain utterance⟯ and ⟮a context⟯ that ⟮give rise to a certain ＿pragmatic act＿.⟯
»⟮A pragmeme⟯« is ⟮＿the emic unit＿⟯ grouping practs.
»⟮Allopracts⟯« are ⟮＿all practs＿⟯ that ⟮result in the same ＿pragmatic act＿.⟯
A prag (my term) is a cover term for pract, pragmeme and pragmatic act.

#### relations to other concepts

In relation to speech acts, ⟮＿the pragmatic act⟯＿ ⟮subsumes⟯ ⟮both ＿illocutionary＿ and ＿perlocutionary act＿⟯.
In terms of the loc/ill/perl distinction, the pragmatic act subsumes illocutionary and perlocutionary parts and are only rarely distinguished
^it seems to me the point is that there is no such thing as a properly illocutionary part in PAT, since no pract may exist without context

## categorization

### loc/ill/perl distinction

The loc/ill/perl distinction is the distinction between locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary part.
The »⟮locutionary part⟯« is ⟮comprised of the expressing of the utterance (with all its phonological, syntactic and semantic aspects)⟯
the »⟮illocutionary part⟯« is ⟮what one does⟯ ⟮in saying something⟯.
the »⟮perlocutionary part⟯« is ⟮what one has done⟯ ⟮due to the consequences of saying something⟯.
The locationary/illocutionary/perlocutionary act is the locutionary/illocutionary/perlocutionary part seen as a speech act.
^This part/act distinction is mine alone.

#### perl/ill distinction

the ⟮＿perlocutionary part＿⟯ ⟮depends of the reaction of the hearers⟯, ⟮c-;＿the illocutionary part＿⟯ ⟮does not⟯.
⟮Frightening⟯ is a ⟮＿perlocutionary＿⟯, not ⟮c_;＿an illocutionary part＿⟯ because ⟮it depends on the hearer to be frightened⟯.

### act type

The act type is the rough pragmatic function of the typeable act.
The 5 act types are ⟮verdictive, commissive, exercitive, expositive, behabitives⟯.


table:name|does|examples
»⟮verdictive⟯«|⟮give a judgement⟯
»⟮commissive⟯«|⟮comitting oneself to a course of action⟯|⟮c+;sb;promising, betting⟯
»⟮exercitive⟯«|⟮exercising power/influence⟯|⟮c+;sb;excommunicating, resigning⟯
»⟮expositivies⟯«|⟮manage the flow/structure of discourse⟯|⟮c+;sb;postulating, defining⟯
»⟮behabitives⟯«|⟮regulating social relationships⟯|⟮c+;sb;toasting, apologizing⟯

## lexical items that give rise to certain speech acts

### pragmatic-only

A pragmatic-only linguistic item (my term) is a lexical item that (almost) exclusively serves a pragmatic function.
A pragmatic-only lexical item is a pragmatic-only linguistic item which is a lexical item.

#### phatic expression

»⟮A phatic expression⟯« is a pragmatic-only linguistic item expressing ⟮a ＿behabitive＿ ＿pragmatic act＿⟯.

#### discourse markers

»⟮A discourse marker⟯« is a pragmatic-only linguistic item ⟮convey an ＿expositive＿ ＿pragmatic act＿⟯.

### more complex

#### backchanneling

»⟮A backchannel⟯« is ⟮an interjection⟯ ⟮during another conversation participants turn⟯ expressing a expositive pragmatic act.
Examples of ⟮＿backchannels＿⟯ in English are e.g. ⟮"yeah", "uh-huh", "hmm", and "right"⟯. 

#### hedge

»⟮a hedge⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic item＿⟯ used to express ⟮the ＿verdictive＿ ＿pragmatic act＿⟯ of ⟮expressing uncertainty⟯.

## specific theories in detail

### Austins original constative/performative distinction

The ⟮original distincition⟯ ⟮Austin⟯ made ⟮c_-;before⟯ ⟮he arrived at speech acts with loc, illoc, perloc aspects⟯ was between ⟮＿constative＿ and ＿performative＿ utterances⟯.
»⟮constative utterances⟯« ⟮have a truth value, state a fact⟯
»⟮performative utterances⟯« ⟮do something else besides state a fact⟯
⟮＿Constative/performative utterances＿⟯ =short=> ⟮constative/performative⟯.

#### hereby-criterion

In ⟮Austins original distinction⟯, ⟮＿the hereby criterion＿⟯ was used to determine if ⟮something was a performative⟯.
»⟮the hereby-criterion⟯«: ⟮An utterance is ＿performative＿⟯ if ⟮inserting the word hereby into the sentence⟯ ⟮basically preserves the meaning⟯
^「I promise to pay you 50$ tomorrow.」→ hereby-criterion →「I hereby promise to pay you 50$ tomorrow.」 → works → performative⟯
^「The cat is on the mat.」→ hereby-criterion →「The cat is hereby on the mat.」 → has changed the meaning → not performative (constative)

#### evolution

A sentence can be ⟮both ＿performative＿ and ＿constative＿⟯, which ⟮blows up austin's original distinction⟯.
⟮Later⟯, ⟮austin⟯ ⟮c_-;moved to⟯ ⟮a distinction between ＿locutionary＿, ＿illocutionary＿ and ＿perlocutionary＿ ＿speech acts＿.⟯

### gricean implicature

⟮＿Implicature＿⟯ is a term introduced by ⟮Grice⟯.
»⟮Implicature⟯« is ⟮whatever a person meant⟯ ⟮by saying something else⟯.
defeasible = cancellable
An ⟮inference (generally an implicature)⟯ is »⟮defeasible⟯« if ⟮it can be erased⟯, e.g. ⟮by saying something contradictory⟯.
⟮＿Implicatures＿⟯ may be ⟮＿conventional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿nonconventional＿⟯.

#### conventional

»⟮A conventional implicature⟯« is ⟮＿an implicature＿⟯ which contains ⟮what a sentence entails⟯ due ot ⟮the conventional meaning of the words involved in the sentence⟯.
⟮＿Conventional implicatures＿⟯ are more or less the same as ⟮entailments⟯.
⟮＿The conventional implicature＿⟯ of "The die is green and heavy" is ⟮"The die is green" (as well as "The die is heavy")⟯

#### nonconventional

»⟮A nonconventional implicature⟯« is ⟮＿an implicature＿⟯ which is ⟮not ＿a conventional implicature＿⟯.
»⟮Conversational implicature⟯« is a type of ⟮＿nonconventional impliciature＿⟯.

##### conversational

⟮CP⟯ is short for ⟮Cooperative Principle⟯
⟮＿Conversational implicatures＿⟯ are ⟮generated by⟯ ⟮＿the cooperative principle＿⟯.
»⟮The CP⟯«: "⟮Make your conversational contribution⟯ ⟮such as is required⟯, ⟮at the stage at which it occurs⟯, ⟮by the accepted purpose or direction⟯ ⟮of the talk exchange in which you are engaged⟯."

###### generation via the CP

⟮＿Conversational implicatures＿⟯ are ⟮generated⟯ when the speaker is ⟮presumed to be⟯ ⟮observing the CP and its maxims⟯, and yet they have ⟮said something⟯ that ⟮c_-2;seems to be⟯ ⟮c_-;violating the CP⟯.
The ⟮generation of⟯ ⟮＿conversational implicatures I⎵c⎵＿⟯ may take ⟮3⟯ forms:
1. ⟮supposition of I⎵c⎵⟯ ⟮makes statement actually consistent with the CP⟯, even ⟮though it did not seem so at first⟯.
2. If ⟮the CP wouldn't have been violated⟯ by ⟮violating the Maxim M1⟯, ⟮the maxim M2 would have been⟯. ⟮Ergo we may deduce I⎵c⎵⟯ and ⟮are consistent with the CP⟯
3. the thing the person is saying ⟮could not possibly be consistent with the CP⟯, ergo ⟮we can assume something completely different as I⎵c⎵⟯ and ⟮be consistent with the CP again⟯ (»⟮flouting⟯«)

Via grice's definition, ⟮violating the CP⟯ at ⟮the level of what was said⟯ is ⟮necessary to conversationally implicate⟯.

!One can also ⟮violate the CP⟯ but⟮ not generate ＿conversational implicatures＿⟯ in ⟮two different⟯ ways:
- !⟮indicating one is opting out of the CP⟯
- !not ⟮indicating one is opting out of the CP⟯, yet ⟮not meaning any of the implicatures⟯, thus ⟮misleading the listener (e.g. lying by omission)⟯

###### grice's razor

⟮＿grice's razor＿⟯ is ⟮the motivation⟯ for ⟮positing⟯ ⟮＿conversational implicatures＿⟯ ⟮c-;rather than⟯ ⟮additional senses or different entities⟯.
»⟮Grice's razor⟯«: ceteris paribus it is ⟮better to postulate⟯ ⟮＿conversational implicatures＿⟯ ⟮c-;rather than⟯ ⟮senses (or different entities)⟯ because ⟮they can be derived from⟯ ⟮independently motivated psychosocial principles⟯.

###### maxims

»⟮The four maxims⟯« are what, if followed, make a thing ⟮cooperative in the sense of the CP⟯.
Some ⟮＿maxims＿⟯ are made up of ⟮submaxims⟯.
⟮＿The four maxims＿⟯ are ⟮quantity⟯, ⟮quality⟯, ⟮relation⟯, ⟮manner⟯.


table:maxim|says
»⟮Quantity⟯«|⟮Make your contribution as informative as required⟯
»⟮Quality⟯«|⟮Try to make your contribution one that is true⟯
»⟮Relation⟯«|⟮Be relevant⟯
»⟮Manner⟯«|⟮Be perspicous⟯


Grice does admit that ⟮there might be other maxims (e.g. politeness)⟯ besides his four at work when talking, but says they are not ⟮relevant for generating implicatures to the same extent/in the same way⟯
⟮⊐⊐⟯ sometimes means "⟮is predicted as an implicature by the CP and its maxims⟯"
⟮⊐⟯ sometimes means "⟮implicates⟯"

####### quantity

»A quantity implicature« is ⟮＿a conversational implicature＿⟯ generated by ⟮violating the ＿maxim of quantity＿⟯
»⟮A scalar implicature⟯« is a type of ⟮＿quantity implicature＿⟯ where ⟮a less informative statement⟯ ⟮c-;implicates⟯ ⟮the deinial of a more informative statement⟯, since otherwise ⟮the maxim of quality would have been violated⟯.

######## implicational scale

In the context of ⟮pragmatics⟯, »⟮implicational scale⟯« is ⟮the scales⟯ from ⟮weaker to stronger⟯ statements that are used in ⟮＿quantity implicatures＿⟯

```lang=text;
{all, most, many, some}
{always, often, sometimes}
{succeed in, try to, want to}
{certain, probable, possible}
```
