## typology

### pragmatic effect

#### interrogative

##### adding constituents

###### tag questions

question tag simple lexical units: right?, no?, huh?
question tag complex constituent: AUX + PRON

In english, question tag simple lexical units always produce a question of the same polarity as the declarative clause.
In english, POS declarative clause + POS question tag complex constituent = sarcastic, theoretically POS non-question.
^You know the answer, do you?
In english, POS declarative clause + NEG question tag complex constituent = POS question.
^Nice here, isn't it?
In english, NEG declarative clause + POS question tag complex constituent = NEG question.
^You don't like beetroot, do you?

##### word order

###### english

####### I-to-C movement

In english, wh-questions and yes/no questions alike are marked by I-to-C movement.
In english interrogatives that are not subject questions, the sentence becomes a CP.
In english interrogatives, the newly formed C position is filled by I moving to C.
In english interrogatives, if there is no I to move to C, I is made pronounced via do-support.

####### wh-movement

A wh-question is a interrogative sentence using a wh-word.
Wh-questions typically feature wh-movement.
wh-movement is a form of head movement.
The wh-constituent moves from and therefore its trace is to be found in where it would be in an answer to the question, unless it is in situ.
A wh in situ question is a wh-question where the wh-prhase does not move.
She was reading what? They went where? She spoke to who(m)?
A subject question in english is where the wh-phrase is the subject of the sentence.
Of the wh-questions, subject questions are the only ones that don't feature I to C movement, and thus also no do-support.
the syntax of a subject question has the same syntax as a statement.

Places out of which constituents for wh-questions are impossible to extract   islands
There are a bunch of islands:
- No extraction of one of the conjuncts of a coordinated phrase.
- No extraction out of a CP inside a DP
- No extraction out of a subject (for most English speakers)
- No extraction out of adjuncts
Besides out of islands, wh-movement will be ungrammatical if it does not comply with the shortest move / minimal link condition: The move must be the shortest possible = there must not be a wh-element that would have to move less far.

###### interrogative words ＆ particles

Wh-words are words starting with wh which are nterrogative words creating open questions.
wh-questions are questions created by wh-words.

# connection

## coordination


## subordination

A complement clause is an argument of a predicate.
A complementizer turns a clause into the subject or object of a sentence.
In english, the complementizer 'that' sometimes is unpronounced
Akane thought that Lilly was a いい子. ⇒ Akane thought Lilly was a いい子.
