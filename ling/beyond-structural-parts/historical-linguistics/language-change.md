# language change

⟮＿Language change＿⟯ is mainly studied in ⟮＿historical linguistics＿⟯.
»⟮Language change⟯« is the ⟮change⟯ in ⟮＿the linguistic items＿⟯ of ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮c_-2;over time⟯.

## what changes?

### sound change

»⟮Sound change⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ where ⟮c_;the thing that is changing⟯ is ⟮sounds⟯.
⟮＿Sound change＿⟯ may be ⟮phonetic⟯ or ⟮c_;phonemic⟯.

### semantic change

»⟮Semantic change⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ of ⟮＿sememe(s)＿⟯ of ⟮a particular ＿lexical unit＿⟯.
⟮Semantic change⟯ = ⟮semantic shift⟯ = ⟮semantic drift⟯

Common types of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ are ⟮narrowing/widening⟯, ⟮amelioration/pejoration⟯

#### widening/narrowing

⟮Semantic widening/narrowing⟯ is commonly abbreviated as ⟮widening/narrowing⟯
⟮Widening/narrowing⟯ is also known as ⟮generalization/specialization⟯.
»⟮Widening/narrowing⟯« is the form of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ where ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ takes on ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ of ⟮one of its ＿hyper/hyponyms＿⟯.
e.g. assassin: specific order of killers -&gt; any killer; starve: die -&gt; die by lack of food; wife: any woman -&gt; woman to whom one is married

#### amelioration/pejoration

⟮amelioration/pejoration⟯ is also known as ⟮elevation/degeneration⟯
»⟮Amelioration/pejoration⟯« is the form of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ of ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ ⟮becomes more positive/negative⟯.
e.g. pretty: sly -&gt; beautiful; knight: servant -&gt; feudal warrior; villain: serf -&gt; evildoer; knave: servant -&gt; rogue

### lexis

#### relexification

»⟮Relexification⟯« is replacing ⟮most/all⟯ of ⟮＿the lexis＿⟯ ⟮of one languoid with that of another languoid⟯ while ⟮leaving the grammar intact⟯

## why do things change

### language contact

»⟮Language contact⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ due to ⟮the influence of other languoid(s)⟯.
»⟮Contact linguistics⟯« is the field that studies ⟮＿language contact＿⟯

#### borrowing

»⟮Borrowing⟯« is a ⟮form of⟯ ⟮＿language change＿⟯ ⟮c-;caused by⟯ ⟮＿language contact＿⟯.
»⟮Borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮gaining⟯ ⟮＿a recipium＿⟯ ⟮c-;via⟯ ⟮＿a donum＿⟯.
⟮＿Donum and recipium＿⟯ (my terms) are both ⟮＿linguemes＿⟯.
»⟮The donor language⟯« is ⟮＿the languoid＿⟯ ⟮whence⟯ ⟮＿the donum＿⟯.
»⟮The recipient language⟯« is ⟮＿the languoid＿⟯ ⟮wither⟯ ⟮＿the recipium＿⟯.
»⟮A borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a lingueme＿⟯ ⟮aquired via ＿borrowing＿⟯.
»⟮A native word⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ that is ⟮not ＿a borrowing＿⟯.
⟮＿Borrowing＿⟯ is ⟮categorized by⟯ ⟮what kind of ＿linguistic items＿⟯ ⟮＿the donum＿ and ＿the recipium＿ are⟯.
Sometimes various borrowing-related terminology is used differently.

##### recipium

###### sememes

»⟮A semantic loan⟯« is a type of ⟮＿borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿donum＿ and ＿recipium＿⟯ are ⟮＿sememes＿⟯.
In a »⟮semantic loan⟯«, ⟮＿a lexical item＿⟯ ⟮exists in two languoids⟯, but is ⟮lacking ＿a sememe＿⟯ in ⟮the ＿recipient language＿⟯, which ⟮is then transferred⟯.
realize (make happen, become aware of) / realisieren (make happen) → realize (make happen, become aware of) / realisieren (make happen, become aware of)

###### lexical units

When ⟮＿a recipium＿⟯ is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯, ⟮c_-;＿the donum＿⟯ may be a ⟮lexical unit⟯, ⟮a morphological pattern/tree structure⟯, ⟮a morpheme⟯, or ⟮a sememe⟯.
⟮＿Foreign words＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿loanwords＿⟯ are ⟮＿borrowings＿⟯ where the ⟮＿recipium＿⟯ is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the donum＿⟯ is ⟮＿the same lexical unit＿⟯.
The difference between them is that »⟮foreign words⟯« ⟮are still recognizably foreign⟯, while »⟮c-;loanwords⟯« ⟮have been completely integrated into the recipient language⟯.
»⟮A loan formation⟯« is ⟮＿a borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the recipium＿⟯ is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the donum＿⟯ is ⟮a morphological pattern/tree structure of a lexical unit⟯, which ⟮is filled with native morphemes⟯.
⟮＿Loan translations＿⟯ and ⟮＿loan renditions＿⟯ are the two types of ⟮＿loan formations＿⟯.
The difference between them is that »⟮loan translations⟯« ⟮translate all segments exactly⟯, while »⟮c-;loan renditions⟯« ⟮only translates the segments roughly⟯.
While weekend → Wochenende is a ⟮＿loan translation＿⟯, skyscraper → Wolkenkratzer is a ⟮c_;＿loan rendition/rendering＿⟯
⟮Calque⟯ is a synonym for ⟮loan translation⟯.
»⟮A loanblen⟯«d is ⟮＿a borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the recipium＿⟯ is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the donum＿⟯ is ⟮＿a morpheme＿⟯, which is ⟮combined with (a) native morpheme(s)⟯
»⟮A loan creation⟯« is ⟮＿a borrowing＿⟯ where ⟮＿the recipium＿⟯ is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the donum＿⟯ is ⟮＿a sememe＿⟯.

##### properties

###### learned

»⟮A learned borrowing⟯« is a ⟮planned, purposeful⟯ ⟮＿borrowing＿⟯.
⟮＿Learned borrowing＿⟯ refers ⟮especially⟯ to ⟮＿borrowings＿ from a classical language⟯.

###### pseudo

⟮pseudo-borrowing⟯ = ⟮false borrowing⟯
»⟮A pseudo-borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a lingueme＿⟯ which ⟮seems to be a ＿borrowing＿, but isn't.⟯

## more complex phenomena

### dialect levelling

»⟮Dialect levelling⟯« is ⟮the reduction of the distinctive linguistic items⟯ of ⟮a non-standard variety⟯ towards ⟮c-;more similarity with⟯ ⟮the standard variety⟯.
Since the industrial revolution, ⟮＿dialect levelling＿⟯ has been ocurring to ⟮most languages⟯.
