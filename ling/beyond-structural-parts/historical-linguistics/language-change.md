⟮＿Language change＿⟯ is mainly studied in ⟮＿historical linguistics＿⟯.
»⟮Language change⟯« is the ⟮change⟯ in ⟮＿the linguistic items＿⟯ of ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮c_-2;over time⟯.

## what changes?

### sound change

»⟮Sound change⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ where ⟮c_;the thing that is changing⟯ is ⟮sounds⟯.
⟮＿Sound change＿⟯ may be ⟮phonetic⟯ or ⟮c_;phonemic⟯.

### semantic change

»⟮Semantic change⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ of ⟮＿sememe(s)＿⟯ of ⟮a particular ＿lexemic unit＿⟯.
⟮Semantic change⟯ =syn= ⟮semantic shift⟯ =syn= ⟮semantic drift⟯

Common types of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ are ⟮narrowing/widening⟯, ⟮amelioration/pejoration⟯

#### widening/narrowing

⟮Semantic widening/narrowing⟯ =short=> ⟮widening/narrowing⟯
⟮Widening/narrowing⟯ =syn= ⟮generalization/specialization⟯.
»⟮Widening/narrowing⟯« is the form of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ where ⟮＿a lexemic unit＿⟯ takes on ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ of ⟮one of its ＿hyper/hyponyms＿⟯.
e.g. assassin: specific order of killers -&gt; any killer; starve: die -&gt; die by lack of food; wife: any woman -&gt; woman to whom one is married

#### amelioration/pejoration

⟮amelioration/pejoration⟯ =syn= ⟮elevation/degeneration⟯
»⟮Amelioration/pejoration⟯« is the form of ⟮＿semantic change＿⟯ where ⟮＿the sememe＿⟯ of ⟮＿a lexemic unit＿⟯ ⟮becomes more positive/negative⟯.
e.g. pretty: sly -&gt; beautiful; knight: servant -&gt; feudal warrior; villain: serf -&gt; evildoer; knave: servant -&gt; rogue

### lexis

»⟮lexical change⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ of ⟮＿the lexis＿ of a languoid⟯.

#### relexification

»⟮Relexification⟯« is ⟮＿lexical change＿⟯ that is replacing ⟮most/all⟯ of ⟮＿the lexis＿⟯ ⟮of one languoid with that of another languoid⟯.
^while changing nothing else

##### properties

###### learned

»⟮A learned borrowing⟯« is a ⟮planned, purposeful⟯ ⟮＿borrowing＿⟯.
⟮＿Learned borrowing＿⟯ refers ⟮especially⟯ to ⟮＿borrowings＿ from a classical language⟯.

###### pseudo

⟮pseudo-borrowing⟯ = ⟮false borrowing⟯
»⟮A pseudo-borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a lingueme＿⟯ which ⟮seems to be a ＿borrowing＿, but isn't.⟯

## why do things change

### language contact

»⟮Language contact⟯« is ⟮＿language change＿⟯ due to ⟮the influence of other languoid(s)⟯.
»⟮Contact linguistics⟯« is the field that studies ⟮＿language contact＿⟯

#### borrowing

»⟮Borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ ⟮gaining⟯ ⟮＿a recipium＿⟯ ⟮c-;via⟯ ⟮＿a donum＿⟯ ⟮via⟯ ⟮＿language contact＿⟯.
A donum/recipium is a linguistic item from the donor/recipient languoid.
»⟮The donor/recipient language⟯« is ⟮＿the languoid＿⟯ ⟮whence/wither⟯ ⟮＿the donum＿/＿the recipium＿⟯.
The borrowing carriers (my term) are the things that already exists in both languoids and thus stay the same in a borrowing.
The borrowing constant (my term) is the thing that is transferred in a borrowing.

##### categorizing items

»⟮A borrowing⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic item＿⟯ ⟮aquired via ＿borrowing＿⟯.
»⟮A native item⟯« is ⟮＿a linguistic item＿⟯ that is ⟮not ＿a borrowing＿⟯.

##### borrowing constants

A sememic/morphemic/lexemic... borrowing is a borrowing where the borrowing constants are sememes/morphemes/lexemes.

###### sememes

»⟮A semantic loan⟯« is a sememic borrowing where the borrowing carriers are lorphemes.
realize (make happen, become aware of) / realisieren (make happen) → realize (make happen, become aware of) / realisieren (make happen, become aware of)
A loan creation is a sememic borrowing where the borrowing carriers are lorphemes, but the lorpheme in the recipient language is newly created for this purpose.

###### lexemic units

A lexemic unit borrowing may result in a foreign word or a loanword.
A foreign word/loanword is a lexemic unit borrowing where the borrowing carriers are sememes and which has not/has been assimilated phonologically/morphologically/graphemically.

###### morphemes

A loan formation is a borrowing where the borrowing constant is a sequence of morpheme signifieds and the borrowing carriers are sets of actual morphemes.
A loan translation/rendition is a loan formation where the morpheme signifieds are realized by strict/rough translations.
^weekend → Wochenende is a ＿loan translation＿, skyscraper → Wolkenkratzer is a ＿loan rendition/rendering＿
⟮Calque⟯ =syn= ⟮loan translation⟯.
A loanblend is a lexemic unit formed using a morpheme borrowing.

## more complex phenomena

### dialect levelling

»⟮Dialect levelling⟯« is ⟮the reduction of ＿linguistic distance＿⟯ of ⟮＿a non-standard variety＿⟯ towards ⟮more similarity with⟯ ⟮c_-;＿the standard variety＿⟯.
Since the industrial revolution, ⟮＿dialect levelling＿⟯ has been ocurring to ⟮most languoids⟯.
