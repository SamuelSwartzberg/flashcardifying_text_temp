# writing systems

## n-graphia

n-graphia is having exactly n writing systems for a languoid.
»⟮c1;2+/3+graphia⟯« (my term) is having 2/3 or more ＿writing systems＿ for a single languoid.
Bigraphia (rare-ish term) is n-graphia where n=2.
»⟮Digraphia⟯« (more useful but not universal definition) is 2+graphia where the writing systems are hierarchical.
Digraphia is often used merely as a synonym for 2+graphia.
Multigraphia is both rare and ambiguous between 2+/3+graphia.
