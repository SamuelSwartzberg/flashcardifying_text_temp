## what is a clause

»⟮A clause⟯« is ⟮a type of ＿constituent＿⟯ ⟮one (conceptual) level higher⟯ than ⟮＿phrases＿⟯.
»⟮A clause⟯« ⟮links⟯ ⟮＿the subject＿⟯ with ⟮＿a predicate (wide sense)＿⟯. 
Clauses which seem to not have a subject have a null subject.

### predicate

»⟮A predicate (narrow sense)⟯« is ⟮the thing that⟯ ⟮connects ＿the subject＿ to an idea⟯.
»⟮A predicate (wide sense)⟯« is ⟮all of the clause⟯ that ⟮says something about ＿the subject＿⟯.
^e.g. Bill heard Fred -> heard (narrow); heard Fred (wide)

## typology

### pragmatic effect

#### interrogative

»⟮An interrogative clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ with ⟮＿the pragmatic effect＿⟯ of ⟮＿a question＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogative clauses＿⟯ ⟮are created⟯ using a variety of devices: ⟮＿inflection＿⟯, ⟮word order/syntactic changes⟯, ⟮addition of ＿constituent(s)＿ or ＿lexical unit(s)＿⟯, ⟮＿phonotactic＿ changes⟯ or a combination.
Often, ⟮＿interrogative clauses＿⟯ are indicated ⟮＿graphemically＿⟯ via ⟮special ＿punctuation＿⟯. 

##### interrogatives

⟮Interrogative word⟯ =syn= ⟮interrogative⟯
»⟮An interrogative⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ used ⟮in creating ＿an interrogative clause＿⟯.
»⟮An interrogative particle⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a particle＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogatives＿⟯ may be instantiated by ⟮different ＿parts of speech＿⟯.

##### question (here instead of in → pragmatics for now)

»⟮A question⟯« is a kind of ⟮＿pragmatic effect＿⟯.
⟮＿A question＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a polar question＿⟯, ⟮＿an alternative question＿⟯, or ⟮＿an open question＿⟯.
»⟮A polar question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a  or negation.
»⟮An alternative question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a choice of given alternatives, or a negation.
»⟮An open question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which allows for any number of possible answers (including a negation).

###### polar question

»⟮The polar question polarity⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿the polarity＿ of ＿the polar question＿⟯ itself, which ⟮changes ＿the polarity of the presumed response＿⟯.
»⟮The polarity of the presumed response⟯« (my term) is ⟮which⟯ ⟮＿truth/falsity polarity＿⟯ ⟮c_-;of the response⟯ ⟮counts as confirmation/negation of the question⟯.
Languoids may have ⟮either two, three or four⟯ types of ⟮＿polarity-expressing things＿⟯ that ⟮answer ＿polar questions＿⟯.
If a languoid has ⟮2/4⟯ ⟮types of ＿polarity-expressing things＿ to answer polar questions⟯, these ⟮do not/do⟯ ⟮distinguish between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation⟯.
A languoid with ⟮3⟯ ⟮types of ＿polarity-expressing things＿ to answer polar questions⟯ ⟮distinguishes between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation⟯ ⟮only when answering negative polar questions (the hard case)⟯.
A language I speak with ⟮3⟯ types of ＿polarity-expressing things＿ to answer polar questions is ⟮German⟯.

##### creation

###### adding constituents

####### tag questsions

»⟮A tag question⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative clause＿⟯ which is formed from ⟮＿a declarative clause＿⟯ plus ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯.
⟮＿Tag questions＿⟯ express ⟮＿polar questions＿⟯.
»⟮A question tag⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ required for ⟮creating ＿a tag question＿⟯.
⟮＿A question tag＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a question tag simple lexical unit＿⟯, or ⟮＿a question tag complex constituent＿⟯.
»⟮a question tag simple lexical unit⟯« is ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯ which is ⟮a single ＿lexical unit＿⟯.
»⟮a question tag complex constituent⟯« is ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯ which is ⟮＿a constituent＿ with more complex internal structure⟯.
In ⟮＿a tag question＿⟯, ⟮both ＿the declarative clause＿ and ＿the question tag＿⟯ ⟮can (possibly) have ＿positive/negative polarity＿⟯.
The ⟮four (2*2)⟯ ⟮possible ＿polarity＿ combinations⟯ in ＿a tag question＿ may create ⟮various combinations of⟯ ⟮＿polarity of the expected answer＿⟯ and ⟮＿pragmatic effects＿⟯.
Most languages have ⟮multiple different⟯ question tags.

## (clausal) relationshps

### syntactic

»⟮A independent clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ that ⟮could be a sentence on its own⟯.
»⟮A dependent clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ that ⟮could not be a sentence on its own⟯.
⟮All⟯ dependent clauses ⟮c_;are⟯ subordinate clauses, ⟮c_;but not the reverse⟯.
⟮＿A clause＿⟯ is ⟮＿embedded＿⟯ in ⟮c_-;another ＿clause＿⟯ if ⟮it is part of it⟯.
»⟮A subordinate clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ which is ⟮＿embedded in＿⟯ and thus ⟮in a relationship of ＿subordination＿ with⟯ ⟮another ＿clause＿⟯.
»⟮A superordinate clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ ⟮containing a given ＿subordinate clause＿⟯.
»⟮An embedded clause⟯« is ⟮＿a subordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮is surrounded by its ＿subordinate clause＿⟯.
^ergo one that isn't at the beginning or end of the sentence.
»⟮A matrix clause⟯« is ⟮＿the clause＿⟯ ⟮in which ＿an embedded clause＿ is ＿embedded＿⟯.
»⟮The main clause⟯« is ⟮the part of ＿the superordinate clause＿⟯ which ⟮is not ＿the subordinate clause＿⟯.
!^this is a rare definition, but a useful one, and endorsed by Martin Haspelmath
»⟮The root clause⟯« is ⟮the uppermost (tree-wise)⟯ ⟮＿matrix clause＿⟯ ⟮c_-;in the sentence⟯.

#### independent clause

##### (null) subjects

»⟮A null subject⟯« is a ⟮＿unpronounced＿⟯ ⟮c_;＿subject＿⟯.
»⟮A null-subject language⟯« is ⟮＿a languoid＿⟯ which ⟮permits ＿null subjects＿⟯ ⟮in ＿independent clauses＿⟯.
Languages I speak that are ＿⟮null-subject⟯ languages＿ are ⟮spanish⟯ and ⟮c_;japanese⟯.

##### cleft sentence
