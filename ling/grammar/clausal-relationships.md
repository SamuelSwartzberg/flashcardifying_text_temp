## what is a clause

»⟮A clause⟯« is ⟮a type of ＿constituent＿⟯ ⟮one (conceptual) level higher⟯ than ⟮＿phrases＿⟯.
»⟮A clause⟯« ⟮links⟯ ⟮＿the subject＿ (expressed or not)⟯ with ⟮＿a predicate (wide sense)＿⟯. 
!^this may not hold in non PIE languages, but I don't have a better definition atm.

### predicate

»⟮A predicate (narrow sense)⟯« is ⟮the thing that⟯ ⟮connects ＿the subject＿ to an idea⟯.
»⟮A predicate (wide sense)⟯« is ⟮all of the clause⟯ that ⟮says something about ＿the subject＿⟯.
^e.g. Bill heard Fred -> heard (narrow); heard Fred (wide)

## typology

### pragmatic effect

#### interrogative

»⟮An interrogative clause⟯« is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯ with ⟮＿the pragmatic effect＿⟯ of ⟮＿a question＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogative clauses＿⟯ ⟮are created⟯ using a variety of devices: ⟮＿inflection＿⟯, ⟮word order/syntactic changes⟯, ⟮addition of ＿constituent(s)＿ or ＿lexical unit(s)＿⟯, ⟮＿phonotactic＿ changes⟯ or a combination.
Often, ⟮＿interrogative clauses＿⟯ are indicated ⟮＿graphemically＿⟯ via ⟮special ＿punctuation＿⟯. 

##### interrogatives

⟮Interrogative word⟯ =syn= ⟮interrogative⟯
»⟮An interrogative⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ used ⟮in creating ＿an interrogative clause＿⟯.
»⟮An interrogative particle⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a particle＿⟯.
⟮＿Interrogatives＿⟯ may be instantiated by ⟮different ＿parts of speech＿⟯.

##### question (here instead of in → pragmatics for now)

»⟮A question⟯« is a kind of ⟮＿pragmatic effect＿⟯.
⟮＿A question＿⟯ may be ⟮＿a polar question＿⟯, ⟮＿an alternative question＿⟯, or ⟮＿an open question＿⟯.
»⟮A polar question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a confirmation or negation.
»⟮An alternative question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which expects a choice of given alternatives, or a negation.
»⟮An open question⟯« is ⟮＿a question＿⟯ which allows for any number of possible answers (including a negation).

###### polar question

The polar question polarity (my term) is the polarity of the polar question, which changes the polarity of the presumed response.
Languages may have either two, three or four types of lexical units/constituents to answer polar questions.
If a language has 2/4 types of lexical units/constituents to answer polar questions, these do not/do distinguish between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation.
A language with 3 types of lexical units/constituents to answer polar questions distinguishes between truth/falsity and confirmation/negation when answering negative polar questions (the hard case).
A language I speak with 3 types of lexical units/constituents to answer polar questions is German.

##### creation

###### adding constituents

####### tag questsions

»⟮A tag question⟯« is ⟮＿an interrogative clause＿⟯ which is formed from ⟮＿a declarative clause＿⟯ plus ⟮＿a question tag＿⟯.
Tag questions express polar questions.
A question tag is a constitent required for creating a tag question.
A question tag may be a question tag simple lexical unit, or a question tag complex constituent.
a question tag simple lexical unit is a question tag which is a single lexical unit.
a question tag complex constituent is a question tag which is a constituent with more complex internal structure.
In a tag question, both the declarative clause and the question tag can (possibly) have positive/negative polarity.
The four possible polarity combinations in a tag question may create various combinations of polarity of the expected answer and pragmatic effects.
Most languages have multiple different question tags.

Examples of question tags:
en|right?|no?, or no?
de|stimmts?, gell?, wa?, ne?|nicht wahr?, oder nicht?
es|verdad?|no?

## (clausal) relationshps

### syntactic

Subordinate clause =syn= dependent clause
A subordinate/dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence.
Independent clause =syn= main clause
root clause =syn= matrix clause
Independent/main clause ≈syn≈ root/matrix clause
A independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

#### independent clause

##### (null) subjects

A null subject is a unpronounced/elided subject.
A null-subject language is a language which permits null subjects in independent clauses.
An independent clause always features a subject or has a null subject.
Languages I speak that are null-subject languages are spanish and japanese.

#### subordinate clauses

A subordinate clause is a clause that is in a relationship of subordination.
Subordinate clauses correspond to CPs in syntax. (I think, so don't study yet)
^Thus, they may be adjuncts of the VP or complements of the verb, including in japanese

##### embedded questions

An embedded question is a question that is a subordinate clause.

##### relative clause

A ⟮relative clause⟯ is a ⟮subordinate clause⟯ which ⟮describes the referent of its head⟯.
In indo-european languages, a relative clause is generally introduced by a relative pronoun.
e.g. I met a furry who was passionate.

### semantic

The semantic clausal relationship (my term) is the semantic relationship between two clauses (no matter if coordination or subordination).


table:name|meaning
illative|presents a consequence
cumulative|adds more
adversative|introduces a contrast
disjunctive|selfexpl.
causal|presents a reason
purposive|in order to
conditional|introduce a condition
concessional|admitting, conceding
comparative|comparing
temporal|temporal ordering

### result: sentences

In syntax, a sentence is the largest constituent and the root of all other constituents.
A sentence consists of one or more clausees.
A one-word sentence is a setence only consisting of a sentence word.
A sentence word is a single lexical unit that makes up a one-word sentence.
^No. Yessir! Ouch!

#### simple/complex 

A simple sentence consists of one (main/independent) clause.
A complex sentence consists of at least one main/independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

#### major/minor

A major sentence we might consider a 'normal sentence' following the usual syntactic rules etc.
A minor sentence is a sentence without the usual subject-predicate/constituent structure.
Minor sentences generally do not allow substitution of items of the same word class: Merry Christmas!; *Merry Birthday!

#### transformation

##### cleft sentence

A cleft sentence splits a simple sentence up into a complex sentence. 
Cleft seentence typically put the constituent now in the independent clause into focus.
Syntax of cleft sentences in english: it + conjugated form of to be + X + subordinate clause

# connection

Two (or more) constituents or clauses may be connected via coordination or subordination. 
A conjunction is a thing that connects constitutents or clauses

## coordination

Coordination is linking two constituents/clauses of the same type.
The two things linked via coordination are called conjuncts.
The totality of coordinator(s) and conjuncts forming an instance of coordination is called a coordinate structure.

## subordination

Subordination is linking two constituents/clauses, where one depends on the other.
