## phi-features (noun-related)

»⟮the phi-features⟯« are ⟮a group of⟯ ⟮＿grammatical feature categories＿⟯ ⟮related to ＿nouns＿⟯ which are encoded ⟮＿inflectionally＿⟯.
»⟮A phi-feature⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical feature＿⟯ that is ⟮one of ＿the phi-features＿⟯.
⟮＿The phi-features＿⟯ ⟮often force⟯ ⟮＿agreement＿⟯ on ⟮noun-related things⟯, and sometimes on ⟮c_;verbs⟯ too.
⟮＿The phi-features＿⟯ include ⟮＿number＿⟯, ⟮＿noun class＿⟯ and ⟮＿case＿⟯.

### noun class

»⟮Noun class⟯« is ⟮＿a phi-feature＿⟯ encoding ⟮a variety of different semantic distinctions⟯.
»⟮Grammatical gender⟯« is a type of ⟮＿noun-class system＿⟯ where ⟮＿the grammemes＿ distinguished⟯ are ⟮male, female, and possibly neuter⟯.

### number

»⟮Grammatical number⟯« is ⟮＿a phi-feature＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿sememes/semantic features＿⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the semantic (feature)＿ category⟯ ⟮setlike⟯
⟮＿Grammatical number＿⟯ may be ⟮＿amount number＿⟯ or ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯

#### amount

»⟮Amount number⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿grammatical number＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿amount＿ ＿semantic features＿⟯.


table:name|amount
»⟮Singular⟯«|⟮one⟯
»⟮Dual⟯«|⟮two⟯
»⟮Trial⟯«|⟮three⟯
»⟮Paucal⟯«|⟮a few⟯
»⟮Plural⟯«|⟮more than any of the other numbers available in the language⟯


If a languoid has ⟮＿amount number＿⟯, ⟮most commonly⟯ it ⟮only has⟯ t⟮he two ＿grammemes＿ ＿singular/plural＿⟯.
In languoids with ⟮a ＿singular/plural＿ distinction⟯, most often ⟮＿the singular＿⟯ is ⟮the ＿unmarked＿ form⟯.

##### grouping

»⟮Grouping number⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿grammatical number＿⟯ encoding ⟮the ＿distributivity＿ ＿semantic feature＿⟯.
The grammemes of ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯ are most commonly ⟮＿singulative＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿collective＿⟯.
The »⟮collective⟯« ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯ encodes ⟮[+collective] [+group]⟯.
The »⟮singulative⟯« ⟮＿grouping number＿⟯ encodes ⟮[-collective] [-group]⟯.
In languages with a singulative/collective distinction, the ⟮＿collective＿⟯ form is generally ⟮the ＿unmarked＿ one⟯.

#### !in languages I speak

⟮English⟯, ⟮c_;German⟯ and ⟮c_;Spanish⟯ have ⟮＿amount number＿⟯ distinguishing ⟮＿singular/plural＿⟯.
⟮Japanese⟯ ⟮does not have⟯ ⟮＿grammatical number＿⟯.

### case

»⟮Grammatical case⟯« is ⟮＿a phi-feature＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿semantic relationship＿⟯ and/or ⟮＿argument relationships＿⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical case＿⟯ may be ⟮＿semantic grammatical case＿⟯ or ⟮＿argument grammatical case＿⟯.
»⟮Argument grammatical case⟯« is ⟮＿grammatical case＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿argument relationships＿⟯.
^and thus which exist depend on the morphosyntactic alignment of the language.

#### semantic grammatical case

»⟮Semantic grammatical case⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿grammatical case＿⟯ encoding ⟮＿semantic relationships＿⟯.
⟮Various possible case ＿grams＿⟯ can ⟮overlap⟯, since ⟮most languages only realize a handful of them per language as ＿grammemes＿⟯.

##### movement

##### additional information

»⟮The instrumental-comitative case⟯« is the case ⟮combining ＿instrumental＿ and ＿commitative＿ cases⟯.
^e.g. english with, though that's obv not a case.

## mainly related to verbs

### grammatical person

»⟮Grammatical person⟯« is ⟮＿the grammatical feature category＿⟯ that encodes various sememe(s)/semantic features related to ⟮＿personal deixis＿⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical person＿⟯ is most frequently realized in ⟮personal pronouns⟯ and ⟮verbs⟯
^but sometimes also in other places
⟮Most languages⟯ distinguish ⟮three⟯ ⟮＿grammatical person＿⟯ ⟮＿grammemes＿⟯.
The three ＿grammemes＿ for ＿grammatical person＿ most commonly distinguished are ⟮first⟯, ⟮c_;second⟯ and ⟮c_;third⟯ ⟮c_;person⟯.


table:grammatical person|deictically refers to
»⟮First person⟯«|⟮The speaker⟯
»⟮Second person⟯«|⟮The addressee⟯
»⟮Third person⟯«|⟮neither speaker nor addressee⟯

#### clusivity

»⟮Clusivity⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical feature feature＿⟯ which is ⟮a subfeature of⟯ ⟮＿grammatical person＿⟯.
⟮＿Clusivity＿⟯ encodes ⟮the difference between two kinds of⟯ ⟮first person plural reference⟯.
⟮[+inclusive/-exclusive]⟯ ⟮includes the addressee⟯, ⟮c-;[-inclusive/+exclusive]⟯ ⟮excludes the addressee⟯.

### tense-aspect-mood

»⟮tense-aspect-mood⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮＿tense＿, ＿aspect＿ and ＿mood＿⟯.
⟮＿tense＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿aspect＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿mood＿⟯ are all ⟮＿grammatical feature categories＿⟯ and all ⟮marked on verbs or VPs⟯.
⟮＿tense-aspect-mood＿⟯ ⟮exists as a grouping⟯ since ⟮those three ＿grammatical feature categories＿ are often strongly entangled in a given language and thus hard to separate.⟯

#### tense

»⟮Tense⟯« is ⟮＿the grammatical feature category＿⟯ concerned with ⟮the relation of the time of the event to a point in time.⟯
⟮＿Tense＿⟯ may be split into ⟮＿absolute tense＿⟯ and ⟮＿strict relative tense＿⟯ (though this is complicated, as discussed below).

##### absolute tense

»⟮Absolute tense⟯« is ⟮＿the tense＿⟯ encoding ⟮the time of the action⟯ ⟮relative to the present⟯.
The ⟮possible⟯ ⟮＿absolute tenses＿⟯ are ⟮past⟯, ⟮c_;present⟯ and ⟮c_;future⟯.
»⟮Three-tense languages⟯« have ⟮all three⟯ ⟮＿absolute tenses＿⟯ ⟮as ＿grammemes＿⟯.
»⟮Two-tense languages⟯« have ⟮two⟯ ⟮＿absolute tense＿⟯ ⟮＿grammemes＿⟯.
In ⟮＿two-tense languages＿⟯, ⟮one of the ＿grammemes＿⟯ ⟮unites two ＿absoulte tense＿ ＿grams＿⟯.
⟮＿Two-tense languages＿⟯ have either past/nonpast or future/nonfuture grammemes.
»⟮Tenseless languages⟯« only have one absolute tense grammeme = no tense.

##### relative tense

»⟮strict relative tense⟯« is ⟮the time of the action⟯ ⟮relative to⟯ ⟮a specific point in time⟯. 
⟮＿strict relative tense＿⟯ ⟮can also be analyzed as⟯ ⟮＿spective aspect＿⟯.
⟮＿anterior tense＿⟯ (⟮c_;＿strict relative tense＿⟯) = ⟮＿retrospective aspect＿⟯ (⟮c_;＿spective aspect＿⟯)
⟮＿posterior tense＿⟯ (⟮c_;＿strict relative tense＿⟯) = ⟮＿prospective aspect＿⟯ (⟮c_;＿spective aspect＿⟯)

##### combinations

»⟮Absolute relative tense⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮＿absolute tense＿⟯ and ⟮＿strict relative tense/spective aspect＿⟯.
»⟮relative tense⟯« is ⟮ambiguous between⟯ ⟮＿strict relative tense＿⟯ and ⟮＿absolute relative tense＿⟯.

⟮pluperfect⟯ =short= ⟮plusquamperfct⟯
⟮pluperfect⟯ =syn= ⟮past perfect⟯
»⟮past perfect⟯« = ⟮＿past absolute tense＿⟯ + ⟮＿retrospective aspect＿⟯
»⟮future perfect⟯« = ⟮＿future absolute tense＿⟯ + ⟮＿retrospective aspect＿⟯
»⟮future in the past⟯« = ⟮＿past absolute tense＿⟯ + ⟮＿prospective aspect＿⟯
»⟮future in the future⟯« (??? - doesn't seem to exit) = ⟮＿future absolute tense＿⟯ + ⟮＿prospective aspect＿⟯


#### aspect

»⟮Aspect⟯« is ⟮＿the grammatical feature category＿⟯ encoding ⟮how the event relates⟯ to ⟮time in general⟯.
Depending on ⟮how ＿the grammemes＿ are encoded⟯, aspect may be divided into ⟮＿grammatical aspect＿⟯ and ⟮＿lexical aspect＿⟯.
»⟮Grammatical aspect⟯« is ⟮＿aspect＿⟯ ⟮encoded in ＿inflectional morphology＿⟯.
»⟮Lexical aspect⟯« is ⟮＿aspect＿⟯ ⟮encoded in ＿lexical items＿⟯.

!Regarding meaning encoded, ⟮＿aspect＿⟯ can be divided into
- !⟮＿eventive＿⟯
- !⟮＿howfar＿⟯
- !⟮＿spective＿⟯
- !⟮＿scope＿⟯
- !⟮＿telicity＿⟯

##### eventive

»⟮Eventive aspect⟯« is aspect indicating ⟮how time flows⟯ ⟮within the process/event itself⟯.
While eventive aspects can be ordered hierarchically, languages may ⟮have some aspects deep into the tree while not having others⟯.
e.g. a language might have perfective, imperfective and stative eventive aspect, but not any of the others

###### outline

```
!⟮Eventive⟯
!  ⟮Perfective⟯
!  ⟮Imperfective⟯
!    ⟮Iterative⟯
!    ⟮Frequentative⟯
!    ⟮Habitual⟯
!    ⟮Continuous⟯
!      ⟮Progressive⟯
!      ⟮Stative⟯
```

###### relation

⟮＿Eventive aspect＿⟯ may be divided into ⟮＿perfective aspect＿⟯ and ⟮＿imperective aspect＿⟯.
»⟮perfective aspect⟯« is ⟮＿eventive aspect＿⟯ where the event is ⟮viewed in its entirety ( = without internal complexity)⟯.
»⟮Imperfective aspect⟯« is ⟮＿eventive aspect＿⟯ where the event is ⟮viewed with some sort of internal complexity⟯.

####### imperfect

⟮＿Imperfective aspect＿⟯ may (sometimes) be divided into ⟮＿iterative＿⟯, ⟮＿frequentative＿⟯, ⟮＿habitual＿⟯ and ⟮＿continuous aspect＿⟯ (though there may be others)
⟮＿Habitual＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿iterative＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿frequentative aspect＿⟯ all indicate that ⟮something is repeated⟯.
»⟮Habitual aspect⟯« is ⟮＿imperfective aspect＿⟯ which indicates that the action is repeated ⟮as one would a habit⟯ ⟮on different occasions⟯.
»⟮Frequentative aspect⟯« is ⟮＿imperfective aspect＿⟯ which indicates that the action is repeated ⟮on different occasions⟯, but ⟮not necessarily as one would a habit⟯.
»⟮Iterative aspect⟯« is ⟮＿imperfective aspect＿⟯ which indicates that the action is repeated ⟮during the same occasion⟯.
^e.g.knocking (repeatedly), kissing (repeatedly)
»⟮Continuous aspect⟯« is ⟮＿imperfective aspect＿⟯ which indicates ⟮an ongoing situation/action⟯ ⟮without interruption⟯.

######## continuous

⟮＿Continuous aspect＿⟯ may sometimes be divided into ⟮＿progressive＿⟯ and ⟮＿stative aspect＿⟯.
»⟮Progressive aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a continuous aspect＿⟯ where ⟮the situation/action is evolving/changing⟯.
»⟮Stative aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a continuous aspect＿⟯ where ⟮the situation/action is not evolving/changing⟯.

###### realizations in languges

»⟮Habitual be⟯« is a feature of ⟮＿AAVE＿⟯ indicating ⟮＿habitual aspect＿⟯.
⟮Spanish⟯ distinguishes ⟮＿imperfective＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿perfective aspect＿⟯ as ⟮imperfect/preterite：name⟯ the past tense.

##### howfar

»⟮howfar aspect⟯« (my term) indicates how ⟮the state is changing⟯ ⟮during the specified time⟯.
⟮＿howfar aspect＿⟯ may be ⟮＿inchoative＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿cessative＿⟯ or ⟮c_;ø⟯.
»⟮Inchoative aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a howfar aspect＿⟯ indicating ⟮that something is beginning (however not that something is about to begin)⟯.
»⟮Cessative aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a howfar aspect＿⟯ indicating ⟮that something is ending⟯.

##### prospective/retrospective

»⟮spective aspect⟯« (my term) indicates ⟮when an event takes place⟯ ⟮relative to the reference time⟯.
⟮＿spective aspect＿⟯ may be ⟮＿prospective＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿retrospective＿⟯, or ⟮c_;ø⟯.
»⟮Prospective aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a spective aspect＿⟯ indicating that an event occurs ⟮subsequent⟯ to a reference time.
»⟮Retrospective aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a spective aspect＿⟯ indicating that an event occurs ⟮before⟯ a reference time.
⟮Retrospective aspect⟯ is commonly but confusingly ⟮also called⟯ ⟮perfect aspect⟯.
^not to be confused with perfect⁑ive⁑ aspect

##### gnomic/episodic

»⟮scope aspect⟯« (my term) indicates what ⟮kind of scope⟯ ⟮something being the fact has⟯.
⟮＿Scope aspect＿⟯ may be ⟮＿gnomic＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿episodic＿⟯, or ⟮c_;ø⟯.
»⟮Gnomic aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a scope aspect＿⟯ indicating ⟮general truths⟯.
^sometimes also analzyed as a modality
»⟮Episodic aspect⟯« is ⟮＿a scope aspect＿⟯ indicating ⟮truths that are temporally bounded⟯.

##### telic/atelic

»⟮Telicity⟯« is ⟮＿the aspect＿⟯ of ⟮whether something has a specific endpoint⟯.
⟮＿Telicity＿⟯ is ⟮sometimes also⟯ ⟮analyzed as something else than a aspect⟯.
⟮＿Telicity＿⟯ may be ⟮＿telic＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿atelic＿⟯, or ⟮c_;ø⟯.

#### modality

»⟮modality⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical feature category＿⟯ encoding ⟮possible situations⟯. 
»⟮Mood⟯« is ⟮＿modality＿⟯ ⟮marked on a verb/VP⟯, however ⟮some authors also treat them as synonyms⟯.
⟮Different forms of⟯ ⟮＿modality＿⟯ are ⟮sometimes called flavors⟯.

##### deontic/epistemic, realis/irrealis

⟮＿Modalities＿⟯ are ⟮c_;primarily categorized⟯ with two binaries: ⟮＿deontic/epistemic＿⟯ and ⟮＿realis/irreals＿⟯
»⟮Deontic modalities⟯« are ＿modalities＿ concerned with ⟮how the world ought to be⟯.
»⟮Epistemic modality⟯« are ＿modalities＿ concerned with ⟮knowledge/belief/credence⟯.
»⟮Realis modalities⟯« are ＿modalities＿ that indicate that ⟮something is the case⟯.
»⟮Irrealis modalities⟯« are ＿modalities＿ that indicate that ⟮something is somehow not the case⟯.
⟮Some ＿modalities＿⟯ are ⟮ambiguous between⟯ being ⟮＿realis/irrealis＿ and/or ＿deontic/epistemic＿⟯.
The distinction between different types of modality may not always be ⟮clear-cut⟯.


##### realis epistemic

⟮Most (but not all)⟯ languoids have ⟮a single⟯ ⟮＿realis modality＿⟯ called ⟮＿the indicative modality＿⟯.

Possible ⟮＿epistemic realis modalitites＿⟯ ⟮besides the indicative⟯ are ⟮＿energetic＿⟯ or ⟮the various ＿evidential modalites＿⟯.
»⟮the energetic modality⟯« is an ⟮＿epistemic realis＿⟯ ＿modality＿ indicating ⟮emphasis or strong belief⟯.

###### evidentiality

»⟮Evidentiality (wide sense)⟯« is ⟮＿the grammatical feature category＿⟯ encoding ⟮what kind of evidence there is for a given statement⟯.
⟮＿Evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ is most commonly analyzed as a ⟮＿realis epistemic＿⟯ ⟮＿modiality＿⟯.
⟮Evidential⟯ =syn= ⟮verificational⟯ =syn= ⟮validational⟯
»⟮An evidential⟯« is ⟮＿a grammeme＿⟯ that encodes ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯.

⟮The most common typology⟯ of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ was mainly created by ⟮Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004, 2006)⟯.
There are two kinds of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯: ⟮＿indirectivity＿⟯ and ⟮＿evidentiality proper＿⟯.
⟮＿Indirectivity＿⟯ is sometimes called »⟮type I evidentiality⟯«, ⟮c-;＿evidentiality proper＿⟯ »⟮type II evidentiality⟯«.
⟮＿Indirectivity＿⟯ is the type of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ that encodes ⟮whether evidence exists, but not what kind⟯.
⟮＿Evidentiality proper＿⟯ is the type of ⟮＿evidentiality (wide sense)＿⟯ that encodes ⟮what kind of evidence exists⟯.

####### evidentiality proper

⟮＿Evidentiality proper＿⟯ contains ⟮a certain number of⟯ ⟮＿grammatical feature feature＿⟯s.
Most languages (that have it) build ⟮＿evidentials proper＿⟯ ⟮＿grammemes＿⟯ from ⟮a combination of⟯ ⟮the various ＿grammatical feature features＿⟯ of ⟮c_-3;＿evidentiality proper＿⟯.
⟮＿The grammatical feature features＿⟯ making up ＿the grammatical feature cateogory＿ ⟮＿evidentiality proper＿⟯ are ⟮[+/- witness]⟯, ⟮[+/- firsthand/secondhand/thirdhand]⟯, ⟮[+/- sensory]⟯, ⟮[+/- inferential]⟯, ⟮[+/- reportative]⟯, ⟮[+/- assumed]⟯.
The ＿evidentiality proper＿ ＿grammatical feature feature＿ ⟮[+/- sensory]⟯ may sometimes contain subfeatures ⟮[+/- visual]⟯ and/or ⟮[+/- auditory]⟯
The ＿evidentiality proper＿ ＿grammatical feature feature＿ ⟮[+/- reportative]⟯ may sometimes contain subfeatures ⟮[+/- hearsay]⟯ and/or ⟮[+/- quotative]⟯

##### irrealis epistemic

The common ⟮＿epistemic irrealis＿⟯ ＿modalities＿ are ⟮＿subjunctive＿⟯, ⟮＿potential＿⟯, ⟮＿dubitative＿⟯, ⟮＿speculative＿⟯, ⟮＿hypothetical＿⟯, ⟮＿assumptive＿⟯

»⟮hypothetical⟯«|⟮while something did not happen, it could have happened⟯
»⟮assumptive⟯«|⟮something is true because it is usually true in similar circumstances⟯ (could be realis too imo)
»⟮conditional⟯«|⟮dependent on another thing⟯


The ⟮＿tentative mood＿⟯ is more commonly called ⟮potential⟯, but this ⟮is a different meaning⟯ than the ⟮c_-;potential⟯ in ⟮japanese⟯ 

##### deontic

⟮＿Deontic modality＿⟯ may be roughly divided into ⟮＿commissive＿⟯, ⟮＿directive＿⟯ and ⟮＿volitive＿⟯.
