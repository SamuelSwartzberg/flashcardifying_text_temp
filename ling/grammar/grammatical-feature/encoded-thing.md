The type of numeral may be indicated morphologically or in some other way.

table:type of numeral|indicates|example
ordinal|position in sequence
cardinal|amount/quantity
multipliers|how often should something be multiplied|-fold (e.g. sevenfold), -ce (e.g. thrice)
distributive numerals|how may times each|-ly (e.g. triply)
collective numerals|sets of certain sizes|-ad (e.g. triad)
partivtive|fractions|-th

##### counting systems

The numeric value of a numeral is generally based on one or more counting systems.
A counting system is the numeral system a language uses.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases.
The reuse point (my term) is at which powers of the base a counting system starts reusing terms for bases.
In indo-european languages, the reuse point is 10⎴3⎴.
In east asian languages, the reuse point is 10⎴4⎴.
Because the reuse point in east asian languages is 10⎴4⎴ = 10000, 10000 is used to mean 'a lot'.
