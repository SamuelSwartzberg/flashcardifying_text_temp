##### realizations

»⟮A honorific⟯« is a linguistic item encoding honorifity.

###### T-V

»⟮The T-V distinction (wide)⟯« is realizing ⟮＿honorifity＿⟯ using ⟮＿pronouns＿⟯.
»⟮The T-V distinction (narrow)⟯« is realizing ⟮＿honorifity＿⟯ using ⟮two different⟯ ⟮＿second-person＿ ＿pronouns＿⟯.
⟮＿The T-V distinction (wide, narrow)＿⟯ exists in ⟮many⟯ ⟮Indo-European languages⟯, but not ⟮c_;english⟯.
The name T-V distinction comes from ⟮latin tu/vos⟯.

#### polarity

»⟮Polarity⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical feature category＿⟯ that encodes ⟮the distinction between positive and negative⟯.
A polarity-expressing thing (my term) is a thing which expresses polarity.
A polar context (my term) is a context that has a certain polarity.
»⟮True/false polarity⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿polarity＿⟯ encoding the distinction between ⟮true and false⟯.
»⟮aff/neg polarity⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿polarity＿⟯ encoding the distinction between ⟮affirmation and negation⟯.
Various items ⟮may distinguish between⟯ ⟮＿true/false polarity＿ and ＿aff/neg polarity＿⟯, or ⟮c_-;be ambiguous between them⟯.

##### polarity item

A polarity item is a lexical item that can only appear in an environment with a specific polarity.
A positive/negative polarity item is a polarity item that can only appear in positive/negative polar contexts.

#### posessive

Posession is a grammatical feature category encoding posession.

##### realizations

»⟮A posessive⟯« is a linguistic item encoding ⟮posession⟯.
Posession may be encoded via lexemes or inflectional/derivational morphemes.

###### inflectional

Inflectional morphology instantiating a posessive is genitive/posessive case.

###### lexical

A posessive lexeme is a possessive which is a lexical unit.
Posessive lexemes generally may be posessive verbs, lexemes or pronouns.
A posessive verb/determiner/pronoun is a posessive lexeme which is a verb/determiner/pronoun.

####### verbs

In quite a few languages, the job of a posessive verb is done by existential verbs.
e.g. 金⁑ある⁑よ, hessian dialectal german: das ist mir.

####### determiners

Possessive determiners and pronouns typically reflect grammatical person, number and sometimes other grammatical feature categories to indicate the posessor.

#### numerality

Numerality is a grammatical feature category encoding the semantic ⟮＿the semantic (feature) category＿ ＿setlike＿⟯, but not in nouns.
Numerality may be divided into numerality amount and numerality type.

##### subdivision

###### counting systems

The numerality amount encodes the setlike amount semantic feature category via on one or more counting systems.
In mathematical terms, a counting system is the numeral system a language uses.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases.

####### reuse point

The reuse point (my term) is at which powers of the base a counting system starts reusing terms for bases.
In indo-european languages, the reuse point is 10⎴3⎴.
In east asian languages, the reuse point is 10⎴4⎴.
Because the reuse point in east asian languages is 10⎴4⎴ = 10000, 10000 is used to mean 'a lot'.

###### numerality type

The numerality type roughly encodes the setlike viewpoint and setlike grouping semantic feature category.
The numerality type may be ordinal, cardinal, a multiplier, distributive, collective, partitive.

table:numerality perspective|indicates|example
ordinal|position in sequence
cardinal|amount/quantity
multiplier|how often should something be multiplied|-fold (e.g. sevenfold), -ce (e.g. thrice)
distributive numerals|how may times each|-ly (e.g. triply)
collective numerals|sets of certain sizes|-ad (e.g. triad)
partivtive|fractions|-th

##### realizations

###### numerals

A numeral is a lexical unit or morpheme encoding numerality.
^not other linguistic items, as encoding quantity is also handled via grammatical number.
Typically, numerals consist of a morpheme encoding numerality amount, and optionally some morpheme(s) encoding numerality type.
⟮＿Numerals＿⟯ internally often consist of ⟮some morpheme(s)⟯ indicating ⟮the quantity⟯, and ⟮c-;some morpheme(s)⟯ the ⟮type of numeral⟯.
In most languages, lexemes instantating ⟮＿numerals＿⟯ are either ⟮＿determiners＿⟯, ⟮＿adverbs＿⟯ or ⟮＿nouns＿⟯.

##### classifier

A classifier is a morpheme or lexeme that co-occurs with another element based on that element being part of a certain semantic class.
»⟮A measure word⟯« is ⟮＿a classifier＿⟯ ⟮of ＿a numeral＿⟯.
^perhaps there are no other classifiers than measure words, in which case they would be synonymous
»⟮A numeral quantifier⟯« is ⟮the combination of⟯ ⟮＿a numeral＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿a measure word＿⟯.

###### in languages

in indo-european languages, measure words are ⟮uncommon⟯.
An example for an english measure word is piece of x, e.g. three pieces of paper.
In east asian languages, measure words are ⟮often required⟯.



#### deixis

»⟮A demonstrative⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ encoding ⟮spatial/discourse deixis sememes⟯.
⟮＿Demonstratives＿⟯ are ⟮most frequently⟯ ⟮＿determiners＿⟯ or ⟮＿pronouns＿⟯.
