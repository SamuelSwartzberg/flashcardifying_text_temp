#### numerals

Numerals are instantiated by lexemes, more precisely via derivational morphology.
Numerals internally often consist of some morpheme(s) indicating the quantity, and some morpheme(s) the type of numeral.
In most languages, lexemes instantating numerals are either determiners, adverbs or nouns.

##### classifier

A classifier is a morpheme or lexeme that co-occurs with another element based on that element being part of a certain semantic class.
A measure word is a classifier that appears with a numeral.
^perhaps there are no other classifiers than measure words, in which case they would be synonymous
A numeral quantifier is the combination of a numeral and a measure word.

###### in languages

in indo-european languages, measure words are uncommon.
An example for an english measure word is piece of x, e.g. three pieces of paper.
In east asian languages, measure words are often required.

##### kinds of numerals

The type of numeral is the wway of looking at the numeric value.
The type of numeral may be ordinal, cardinal, a multiplier, distributive, collective, partitive.
The type of numeral may be indicated morphologically or in some other way.

table:type of numeral|indicates|example
ordinal|position in sequence
cardinal|amount/quantity
multipliers|how often should something be multiplied|-fold (e.g. sevenfold), -ce (e.g. thrice)
distributive numerals|how may times each|-ly (e.g. triply)
collective numerals|sets of certain sizes|-ad (e.g. triad)
partivtive|fractions|-th

##### counting systems

The numeric value of a numeral is generally based on one or more counting systems.
A counting system is the numeral system a language uses.
Counting systems across languages may have different bases.
The reuse point (my term) is at which powers of the base a counting system starts reusing terms for bases.
In indo-european languages, the reuse point is 10⎴3⎴.
In east asian languages, the reuse point is 10⎴4⎴.
Because the reuse point in east asian languages is 10⎴4⎴ = 10000, 10000 is used to mean 'a lot'.

#### deixis

Demonstratives are lexemes encoding spatial/discourse deixis sememes.
Demonstratives are most frequently determiners or pronouns.
