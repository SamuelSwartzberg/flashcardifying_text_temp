A grammatical feature category is a set of grams / grammatical features (depending on your analysis) and thus grammemes which divide up a certain semantopragmatic pie.
Sometimes people use grammatical feature for grammatical feature category, but I will use it for 'the features that make up grammemes' as per usual.
Not all languages have all grammatical feature categories.
