# parts of speech

»⟮A part of speech/word class⟯« is ⟮a category of words⟯ with similar ⟮＿syntactic＿⟯,⟮＿ word-formation＿⟯ and sometimes ⟮＿semantic properties＿⟯.
⟮Part of speech⟯ =syn= ⟮word class⟯.
⟮Clear distingction⟯ of ⟮＿word classes＿⟯ are ⟮difficult⟯ ⟮＿interlinguistically＿⟯.
Often ⟮the things we think⟯ ⟮a certain ＿word class＿ does⟯ ⟮c_-;is actually⟯ ⟮what a phrase headed by that thing does⟯.

## abbreviations

table:abbr|name
⟮A⟯|⟮Adjective⟯
⟮P⟯|⟮Adposition (from preposition)⟯
⟮Adv⟯|⟮Adverb⟯
⟮C⟯|⟮Complementizer⟯
⟮D⟯|⟮Determiner⟯
⟮N⟯|⟮Noun⟯
⟮V⟯|⟮Verb⟯

## closed vs open

»⟮a closed word class⟯« is a word class that ⟮rarely or never accepts new members⟯
»⟮an open word class⟯« is a worrd class that ⟮can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members⟯

## categories

A part of speech may be a functional, lexical or practical category.

### functional categories

»⟮A functional category⟯« is ⟮＿a word class＿⟯ that ⟮purely encodes ＿grammemes＿ (however, those can be semantic roles, thus also encoding semantics)⟯.
»⟮a function word⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ that ⟮is a member of ＿a functional category＿⟯.

#### particle

»⟮A particle⟯« is ⟮＿a function word＿⟯ which ⟮cannot be inflected⟯.
»⟮A sentence-final particle⟯« is ⟮＿a particle＿⟯ ⟮occurring at the end of the sentence⟯.
⟮＿Sentence-final particles＿⟯ in particular generally indicate ⟮modality⟯ or ⟮various pragmatic effects⟯.

#### adpositions

Types of ⟮＿adpositions＿⟯: {⟮＿post＿⟯, ⟮＿pre＿⟯, ⟮＿circum＿⟯, ⟮＿ambi＿⟯}
»⟮An ambipositon⟯« is an adposition that may be either a pre- or postposition depending on other factors.

##### semantics

semantically, ⟮＿adpositions＿⟯ may indicate ⟮time⟯, ⟮space⟯, ⟮various semantic roles⟯, or ⟮something else⟯.

##### transitivity

⟮＿Adpositions＿⟯ may be ⟮＿transitive＿⟯ or ⟮＿intransitive adpositions＿⟯.
»⟮A transitive/intransitive adposition⟯« is ＿an adposition＿ that ⟮takes/does not take ＿a complement＿⟯.
⟮＿Intransitive adpositions＿⟯ are often called ⟮＿adverbs＿⟯, though ⟮that's probably an inferior analysis⟯.
⟮＿Transitive adpositions＿⟯ most commonly take ⟮NPs/DPs⟯ or ⟮other adpositional phrases⟯ as ⟮＿complements＿⟯.

### pragmatic categories

»⟮A pragmatic category⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿a word class＿⟯ that mainly encodes ⟮(half of) ＿practs＿⟯.

#### interjections

»⟮Interjection⟯« is ⟮＿a pragmatic category＿⟯ that ⟮indicates a reaction⟯. 
⟮＿Interjections＿⟯ are ⟮pretty separated⟯ from ⟮the rest of the syntax of the sentence⟯.
⟮＿Interjection＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿discourse marker＿⟯ are often used interchangeably, but ⟮c_;＿interjection＿⟯ refers to ⟮the syntactic/morphological class⟯, while ⟮c-;＿discourse marker＿⟯ refers to ⟮the pragmatic class⟯.

### lexical category

»⟮A lexical category⟯« is ⟮＿a word class＿⟯ that (also) encodes ⟮＿sememes＿⟯.
»⟮A content word⟯« is ⟮＿a lexical unit＿⟯ that is ⟮a member of ＿a lexical category＿⟯.
Sometimes lexical category is used as a synonym for part of speech/word class (but I don't like this).

#### ad

An ad phrase (my term) is a phrase that acts as a modifier for another head and thus semantically describes/restricts that head.
Ad phrases may be attributive adjective phrases or adverb phrases.
Attributive adjective phrases are ad phrases that modify things that are not NPs/DPs.
Adverb phrases are ad phrases that modify things that are not NPs/DPs.

##### adjective

An adjective is a lexical unit that can act as the head of an AP, or become the head of an NP.
A nominalized adjective is an adjective that has become the N head of an NP.

###### AP

An adjective phrase may be attributive or predicative.
A predicative adjective phrase is the complement of the VP.

##### adverb

Adverb phrase = adverbial phrase.
»⟮An adverb⟯« is ⟮＿the head＿⟯ of ⟮＿an adverbial phrase＿⟯.
»⟮Adverb(ial) phrases⟯« ⟮are ＿modifiers＿ for⟯ ⟮any number of things⟯ that ⟮are not NPs/DPs⟯.
^bit of a catch-all category
Semantically, ⟮＿adverbial phrases＿⟯ ⟮describe/restrict the thing they're ＿modifying＿⟯.
In most languages, ⟮＿adverbs/adverbial phrases＿⟯ are at least able to modify other AdvPs, APs, DPs, PPs, VPs, and IPs.

#### noun-related

##### noun

Nouns are heads of NPs.
NPs/DPs are the things that most commonly become subjects/objects. 

###### attribution

Something »⟮attributive⟯« is ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ ⟮within a NP/DP⟯ that ⟮modifies the head noun⟯. 
⟮Adnnominal⟯ =syn= ⟮attributive⟯
»⟮An attributive verb⟯« is ⟮a verb⟯ that ⟮can be used ＿attributively＿⟯.

##### det

»⟮A determiner⟯« is a lexical unit that occurs that occurs together with a NP (DP theory) and expresses something about the reference of the NP.
Types of determiners: Articles, quantifiers, posessive determiners, demonstrative determiners, interrogative determiners

##### Quantifier

A quantifier is a determiner that indicates quantity.

###### Articles

An article is a determiner that typically encodes definiteness, and in many languages also gender, number, and/or case.

###### posessive determiners

A posessive determiner is a determiner instantiating a posessive.

## verbs

### copulas and existential verbs

#### copulas

A copula is a constituent that connects subject with complement=predicate.
The tree ☞is☜ blue.
Copulas are most commonly verbs, but not always.
A pseudocopula/semicopula is a constituent that does similar things as a copula, but is grammatically or syntactically more restricted.

#### existential verbs

An existential verb indicates the existence of something.
Some languages distinguish different existential verbs for different semantic categories or grammatical situations.
Japanese distinguishes its existential verbs ある・いる along a inanimate/animate distinction.

#### in languages

The existential verb and the copula may be the same lexical unit, or a different lexical unit.

table:lang|copula|existential verb
en|be|be
es|ser/estar|haber
de|sein|geben
ja|だ|ある・いる

### aux

Auxiliary verbs are function words most commonly indicating verb-related grammemes and/or allowing for more complex syntactic constructions.
Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
modal verbs are a subset of auxiliary verbs that are used to express modality.

#### light verbs

Light verbs are verbs with little semantic content and often used in certain syntactic constructions, but which do not act like auxiliary verbs syntactically.

### lexical

Lexical verbs are verbs that are content words.

#### semantics

##### dynstat

Semantically, lexical verbs can be divided into dynamic and static verbs.
A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action.
A stative verb is a verb that descirbes a state.
^setzen is a dynamic verb while sitzen is a dynamic verb.

## proforms

Proforms are function words or constitutents that stand in for another constituent.

### pronouns

Pronouns are proforms that stand for NPs/DPs.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner

#### pro-drop

A pro-drop language is a language where certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically or grammatically inferable. 
Japanese and Spanish are pro-drop, German and English are, with rare exceptions, not.

#### personal

Personal pronouns are pronouns that are associated primarily with a particular grammatical person.

### changing parts of speech

#### nominalization

Nominalization is the process of treating / transforming something which is not a noun as / into a noun / head of an NP.
A nominalizer is a thing that nominalizes a thing.
Nominalizers are usually bound morphemes.
