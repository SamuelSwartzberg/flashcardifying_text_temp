# arguments

»⟮Argument relationships⟯« (my term) is ⟮the relationships⟯ ⟮＿arguments＿⟯ ⟮c-;can have⟯ ⟮to their verb⟯.
I will call the ⟮max. three⟯ ⟮＿arguments＿⟯ of verbs with ⟮c_;＿valencies＿⟯ ⟮c_-;1-3⟯ ⟮A1, A2, A3⟯.
In my notation for ＿arguments＿, ⟮A1 - A3⟯ is ⟮a logical/conceptual ordering⟯ that⟮ does not have to be⟯ ⟮realized in word order⟯.
»⟮The subject⟯« is ⟮A1 of any verb⟯.
»⟮The object(s)⟯« are ⟮A2 - An of any verb⟯.

## !thematic roles (under the active voice)

Typically ⟮A1 (and thus ＿the subject＿)⟯ is ⟮＿the agent＿⟯.
In cases of ⟮＿intransitive verbs＿⟯, ⟮A1⟯ ⟮may also frequently⟯ be ⟮＿the experiencer＿⟯.
Typically, ⟮A2 (if extant)⟯ is ⟮＿the patient＿⟯.
Typically, ⟮A3 (if extant)⟯ is ⟮＿the theme＿⟯.

## counting arguments

⟮＿Verbs＿⟯ have ⟮0 or more：number⟯ ⟮＿arguments＿⟯.
»⟮Valency⟯« is ⟮the amount of⟯ ⟮＿arguments＿ a ＿verb＿ has⟯.
»⟮Transitivity⟯« is ⟮the amount of⟯ ⟮non-subject arguments a verb has⟯.
⟮Valency⟯ = ⟮Transitivity⟯ ⟮+ 1⟯
»⟮An ambitransitive verb⟯« is a verb with ⟮＿a transitivity＿ of 0 or 1⟯
⟮Both greek and latinate⟯ numerals are used in words counting ⟮＿valency＿ and ＿transitivity＿⟯.

## morphosyntactic alignment

»⟮Morphosyntactic alignment⟯« is ⟮the distribution⟯ of ⟮＿case＿ (incl. word order, but only if it is case-marking)⟯ ⟮c_-;over⟯ ⟮different ＿valencies＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ typically varies by ⟮language⟯, not ⟮c_;within a language⟯.

### A1A2 morphosyntactic alignment

»⟮A1A2 morphosyntactic alignment⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ concerned with verbs with ⟮＿valencies＿ of 1 and 2⟯.


table:n↓\v→|1|2
»⟮nominative-accusative⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C1, A2=C2⟯
»⟮ergative-absolutive⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C2, A2=C1⟯
»⟮direct⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C1, A2=C1⟯
»⟮tripartite⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C2, A2=C3⟯
»⟮transitive⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C2, A2=C2⟯

Languoids ⟮can't be fully⟯ ⟮＿direct＿⟯ or ⟮＿transitive＿⟯ in their ＿A1A2 alignment＿, as languoids ⟮need some way⟯ to ⟮tell A1 and A2 of a verb with valency = 2 apart⟯.

#### case 

##### !⟮s+5:+15;ergative-absolutive⟯

table:Case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮absolutive case⟯«
⟮C2⟯|»⟮ergative case⟯«


In ⟮＿ergative-absolutive languages＿⟯, because ⟮C2⟯ marks ⟮A1 of ＿divalent verbs＿⟯ and ⟮c_;A1 of ＿divalent verbs＿⟯ most often is ⟮＿the agent＿⟯, it is often said that ⟮c_-2;C2⟯ ⟮marks ＿the agent＿ of ＿divalent verbs＿⟯.
⟮ergative-absolutive⟯ =short=> ⟮ergative⟯.

##### !⟮s+5:+15;nominative-accusative⟯

table:case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮nominative case⟯«
⟮C2⟯|»⟮accusative case⟯«


In nominative-accusative languages, typically ⟮＿the nominative case＿⟯ is ⟮＿unmarked＿⟯.
A »⟮marked nominative⟯« ＿morphosyntactic alignment＿ is a ⟮＿nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ where ⟮＿the nominative case＿⟯ is ⟮＿marked＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the accusative case＿⟯ is ⟮＿unmarked＿⟯.
⟮nominative-accusative⟯ =short=> ⟮accusative⟯.

#### more complex

##### split

»⟮Split morphosyntactic alignment⟯« is ⟮having different ＿morphosyntactic alignments＿ under different circumstances (syntactic, grammatical, morphological, etc.)⟯
»⟮Split ergative alignment⟯« is ⟮＿split morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ ⟮between ＿nominative-accusative＿ and ＿ergative-absolutive＿⟯.

##### active

»⟮Active alignment⟯« has ⟮A1=C1 and A2=C2⟯ for v=2 and ⟮A1 = sometimes C1, sometimes C2⟯ for v=1.
Typically, ⟮＿active alignment＿⟯ decides ⟮whether A1 of v=1 gets C1 or C2⟯ based on ⟮the agenthood of A1⟯.
There are two types of ⟮＿active alignment＿⟯, ⟮＿split-S＿⟯ and ⟮＿fluid-S＿⟯.
split-S and fluid-S are named that way because what I usually call A1 of v=1 is more commonly called S.
»⟮Split-S⟯« alignment is ⟮＿active aligment＿⟯ where ⟮the presumed agenthood of A1 of v=1⟯ ⟮has calcified into two classes of verbs⟯, ⟮which require C1 or C2 respectively⟯.
»⟮Fluid-S⟯« alignment is ⟮＿active alignment＿⟯ which ⟮allow the speaker to choose⟯ ⟮the case of A1⟯ and thus ⟮imply agenthood (or not)⟯.

### A2A3 morphosyntacitic alignment

»⟮A2A3 morphosyntactic alignment⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿morphosyntacitc alignment＿⟯ concerned with verbs with ⟮＿valencies＿ of 2 and 3⟯


alignment|v=2|v=3
»⟮dative⟯«|⟮A2=CI⟯|⟮A2=CII, A3=CI⟯
»⟮dechticaetiative⟯«|⟮A2=CI⟯|⟮A2=CI, A3=CII⟯

#### cases

for both dative and dechticaetiative, CI is whatever the case of A2 was for v=2 (see other level of alignments).
CII is dative for languages with dative morphosyntactic alignment.
CII is dechticaetative for languages with dechticaetative morphosyntactic alignment.
In the case of dative morphsynalign, A2 is called direct and A3 indirect object.
In the case of dechticaetative morphsynalign, A2 is called primary and A3 secondary object.
dative morphsynalign=indirective morphsynalign
dechticaetiative morphsynalign=secundative morphsynalign
Primarily dative langauges often still feature some dechticaetiative behavior.

### merging

oblique case =syn= objective case
The oblique case is an argument-marking case that is not C1 (e.g. nominative or absolutive).
Thus, for nom-accus dative morphsynalign the oblique case can be said to merge dative and accusative cases.
English features an oblique case.

### realization

The most common types of morphosyntactic alignments (narrow) are nominative-accusative followed by ergative-absolutive.
Dative morphsynalign is more common than dechticaetiative.
All languages I speak are nominative-accusative languages.

## semantic roles in monovalent verbs

an unergative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is an agent 
^the most common case
an unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose argument is not an agent.

## voice

Voice is a grammatical feature category which changes the valency of a verb and thus semantic roles of the arguments.
Grammatical voice is either active or passivelike.
The active voice is the default, unmarked voice.
Passivelike voices are voices which decrease the valency by demoting an argument.
Demoting an argument is dropping it or realizing it in some less central way.

### passivelike voices

#### valency > 1

##### passive and antipassive.

The passive voice is the passivelike voice for nominative-accusative languages.
The antipassive voice is the passivelike voice for ergative-absolutive languages.
The passive voice demotes A1 and A2 -> A1.
The antipassive voice demotes A2 and A1 -> A1.
Both the passive and antipassive voice result in C2 -> C1.
For both the passive and antipassive voice, the item that is not demoted keeps its thematic role.
Thus, the passive voice can also be said to make the subject into a patient.

##### middle

The middle voice is a passivelike voice where A1 is both the agent and the patient.
Grammatical voice is generally realized on verbs/VPs.
The mediopassive voice is a grammatical voice that merges the middle voice and the passive voice.

#### valency = 1

The impersonal passive voice is the only passivelike voice which applies to monovalent verbs.
The impersonal passive voice reduces the valency of an monovalent verb to zero.
Some languages may achieve an effect similar to the impersonal passive voice by inserting a dummy element.
