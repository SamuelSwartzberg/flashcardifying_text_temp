# arguments

»⟮Argument relationships⟯« (my term) is ⟮the relationships⟯ ⟮＿verbal arguments＿⟯ ⟮c-;can have⟯ ⟮to their verb⟯.
»⟮A verbal argument⟯« is ⟮＿an argument＿⟯ ⟮of a verb⟯.
I will call the ⟮max. three⟯ ⟮＿verbal arguments＿⟯ of verbs with ⟮c_;＿valencies＿⟯ ⟮c_-;1-3⟯ ⟮A1, A2, A3⟯.
In my notation for ＿verbal arguments＿, ⟮A1 - A3⟯ is ⟮a logical/conceptual ordering⟯ that⟮ does not have to be⟯ ⟮realized in word order⟯.
»⟮The subject⟯« is ⟮A1 of any verb⟯.
»⟮The object(s)⟯« are ⟮A2 - An of any verb⟯.

## !thematic roles (under the active voice)

Typically ⟮A1 (and thus ＿the subject＿)⟯ is ⟮＿the agent＿⟯.
In cases of ⟮＿intransitive verbs＿⟯, ⟮A1⟯ ⟮may also frequently⟯ be ⟮＿the experiencer＿⟯.
Typically, ⟮A2 (if extant)⟯ is ⟮＿the patient＿⟯.
Typically, ⟮A3 (if extant)⟯ is ⟮＿the theme＿⟯.

## counting verbal arguments

⟮＿Verbs＿⟯ have ⟮0 or more：number⟯ ⟮＿verbal arguments＿⟯.
»⟮Valency⟯« is ⟮the amount of⟯ ⟮＿verbal arguments＿ a ＿verb＿ has⟯.
»⟮Transitivity⟯« is ⟮the amount of⟯ ⟮non-subject verbal arguments a verb has⟯.
⟮Valency⟯ = ⟮Transitivity⟯ ⟮+ 1⟯
»⟮An ambitransitive verb⟯« is a verb with ⟮＿a transitivity＿ of 0 or 1⟯
⟮Both greek and latinate⟯ numerals are used in words counting ⟮＿valency＿ and ＿transitivity＿⟯.

## morphosyntactic alignment

»⟮Morphosyntactic alignment⟯« is ⟮the distribution⟯ of ⟮＿case＿ (incl. word order, but only if it is case-marking)⟯ ⟮c_-;over⟯ ⟮different ＿valencies＿⟯.
⟮＿Morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ typically varies by ⟮language⟯, not ⟮c_;within a language⟯.

### A1A2 morphosyntactic alignment

»⟮A1A2 morphosyntactic alignment⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ concerned with verbs with ⟮＿valencies＿ of 1 and 2⟯.


table:n↓\v→|1|2
»⟮nominative-accusative⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C1, A2=C2⟯
»⟮ergative-absolutive⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C2, A2=C1⟯
»⟮direct⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C1, A2=C1⟯
»⟮tripartite⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C2, A2=C3⟯
»⟮transitive⟯«|⟮A1=C1⟯|⟮A1=C2, A2=C2⟯

Languoids ⟮can't be fully⟯ ⟮＿direct＿⟯ or ⟮＿transitive＿⟯ in their ＿A1A2 alignment＿, as languoids ⟮need some way⟯ to ⟮tell A1 and A2 of a verb with valency = 2 apart⟯.

#### case 

##### !⟮s+5:+15;ergative-absolutive⟯

table:Case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮absolutive case⟯«
⟮C2⟯|»⟮ergative case⟯«


In ⟮＿ergative-absolutive languages＿⟯, because ⟮C2⟯ marks ⟮A1 of ＿divalent verbs＿⟯ and ⟮c_;A1 of ＿divalent verbs＿⟯ most often is ⟮＿the agent＿⟯, it is often said that ⟮c_-2;C2⟯ ⟮marks ＿the agent＿ of ＿divalent verbs＿⟯.
⟮ergative-absolutive⟯ =short=> ⟮ergative⟯.

##### !⟮s+5:+15;nominative-accusative⟯

table:case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮nominative case⟯«
⟮C2⟯|»⟮accusative case⟯«


In nominative-accusative languages, typically ⟮＿the nominative case＿⟯ is ⟮＿unmarked＿⟯.
A »⟮marked nominative⟯« ＿morphosyntactic alignment＿ is a ⟮＿nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ where ⟮＿the nominative case＿⟯ is ⟮＿marked＿⟯ and ⟮c-;＿the accusative case＿⟯ is ⟮＿unmarked＿⟯.
⟮nominative-accusative⟯ =short=> ⟮accusative⟯.

##### !direct

table:case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮direct⟯«

##### !tripartie

table:case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮intransitive case⟯«
⟮C2⟯|»⟮ergative case⟯«
⟮C3⟯|»⟮accusative case⟯«

##### !transitive

table:case number|case name
⟮C1⟯|»⟮intransitive case⟯«
⟮C2⟯|»⟮transitive case⟯«

#### more complex

##### split

»⟮Split morphosyntactic alignment⟯« is ⟮having different ＿morphosyntactic alignments＿ under different circumstances (syntactic, grammatical, morphological, etc.)⟯
»⟮Split ergative alignment⟯« is ⟮＿split morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ ⟮between ＿nominative-accusative＿ and ＿ergative-absolutive＿⟯.

##### active

»⟮Active alignment⟯« has ⟮A1=C1 and A2=C2⟯ for v=2 and ⟮A1 = sometimes C1, sometimes C2⟯ for v=1.
Typically, ⟮＿active alignment＿⟯ decides ⟮whether A1 of v=1 gets C1 or C2⟯ based on ⟮the agenthood of A1⟯.
There are two types of ⟮＿active alignment＿⟯, ⟮＿split-S＿⟯ and ⟮＿fluid-S＿⟯.
⟮＿split-S＿⟯ and ⟮＿fluid-S＿⟯ are named that way because what I usually call ⟮A1 of v=1⟯ is more commonly called ⟮S⟯.
»⟮Split-S⟯« alignment is ⟮＿active aligment＿⟯ where ⟮the presumed agenthood of A1 of v=1⟯ ⟮has calcified into two classes of verbs⟯, ⟮which require C1 or C2 respectively⟯.
»⟮Fluid-S⟯« alignment is ⟮＿active alignment＿⟯ which ⟮allow the speaker to choose⟯ ⟮the case of A1⟯ and thus ⟮imply agenthood (or not)⟯.

### A2A3 morphosyntacitic alignment

»⟮A2A3 morphosyntactic alignment⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿morphosyntacitc alignment＿⟯ concerned with verbs with ⟮＿valencies＿ of 2 and 3⟯


alignment|v=2|v=3
»⟮dative⟯«|⟮A2=CI⟯|⟮A2=CII, A3=CI⟯
»⟮dechticaetiative⟯«|⟮A2=CI⟯|⟮A2=CI, A3=CII⟯

#### cases

For ⟮＿A2A3 morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯, ⟮CI⟯ is ⟮whatever the case of A2 is⟯ for ⟮the given ＿A1A2 morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯.
under ⟮＿dative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯, ⟮CII⟯ is called »⟮dative⟯«.
under ⟮＿dechticaetative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯, ⟮CII⟯ is called »⟮dechticaetative⟯«.
Under ⟮＿dative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯, ⟮A2⟯ is called »⟮direct object⟯« and ⟮c-;A3⟯ »⟮indirect object⟯«.
Under ⟮＿dechticaetative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯, ⟮A2⟯ is called »⟮primary object⟯« and ⟮c-;A3⟯ »⟮secondary object⟯«.
⟮dative morphsynalign⟯ =syn= ⟮indirective morphsynalign⟯
⟮dechticaetiative morphsynalign⟯ =syn= ⟮secundative morphsynalign⟯
Languoids with ⟮primarily ＿dative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ ⟮often still feature⟯ ⟮some ＿dechticaetiative morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯.

### merging

⟮oblique case⟯ =syn= ⟮objective case⟯
»⟮The oblique case⟯« is ⟮＿an argument grammatical case＿⟯ that ⟮is not C1 (e.g. nominative or absolutive)⟯.
Thus, for ⟮＿nominative-accusative＿⟯ & ⟮c_;＿dative＿⟯ ⟮＿morphosyntactic alignment＿⟯ ⟮＿the oblique case＿⟯ can be said to ⟮merge ＿dative＿ and ＿accusative cases＿⟯.
⟮English⟯ features an oblique case.

### realization

The ⟮most common⟯ types of A1A2 morphosyntactic alignments are ⟮＿nominative-accusative＿⟯ followed by ⟮＿ergative-absolutive＿⟯.
For A2A3 morphosyntactic alignments, ⟮＿dative＿⟯ is more common than ⟮＿dechticaetiative＿⟯.
All languages I speak have primarily ⟮＿nominative-accusative＿⟯ ⟮＿dative＿⟯ morphosyntactic alignment.

## semantic roles in monovalent verbs

»⟮an unergative verb⟯« is ⟮＿an intransitive verb＿⟯ ⟮whose ＿verbal argument＿ is ＿an agent＿ ⟯
^the most common case
»⟮an unaccusative verb⟯« is ⟮＿an intransitive verb＿⟯ ⟮whose ＿verbal argument＿ is not ＿an agent＿⟯.

## voice

»⟮Grammatical voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical feature category＿⟯ which ⟮changes the ＿valency＿ of a verb⟯ and thus ⟮＿semantic roles＿ of ＿the verbal arguments＿⟯.
⟮＿Grammatical voice＿⟯ is generally realized on ⟮verbs/VPs⟯.
⟮Grammatical voice⟯ =short=> ⟮voice⟯
⟮＿Grammatical voice＿⟯ is either ⟮＿the active voice＿⟯ or ⟮＿the passivelike voice＿⟯.
»⟮The active voice⟯« is ⟮the default⟯ voice and thus typically ⟮＿unmarked＿⟯.
»⟮A passivelike voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical voice＿⟯ which ⟮＿demotes＿ ＿an verbal argument＿⟯.
»⟮Demoting⟯« ⟮＿an verbal argument＿⟯ is ⟮dropping it⟯ or ⟮realizing it in some less central way⟯, thus ⟮decreasing ＿the valency＿ of the verb⟯.
For ⟮＿passivelike voices＿⟯, ⟮the item that is not ＿demoted＿⟯ ⟮keeps its ＿thematic role＿⟯, even though ⟮it is now a different ＿verbal argument＿⟯.

### passivelike voices

#### valency > 1

##### passive and antipassive.

»⟮The passive voice⟯« is ⟮＿the passivelike voice＿⟯ for ⟮＿nominative-accusative＿⟯ morphosyntactic alignments.
»⟮The antipassive voice⟯« is ⟮＿the passivelike voice＿⟯ for ⟮＿ergative-absolutive＿⟯ morphosyntactic alignments.
»⟮The passive voice⟯« ⟮＿demotes＿ A1⟯ and ⟮A2 → A1⟯.
»⟮The antipassive voice⟯« ⟮＿demotes＿ A2⟯ and ⟮A1 → A1⟯.
Both ⟮＿the passive＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿antipassive voice＿⟯ result in ⟮C2⟯ → ⟮c_;C1⟯.
⟮＿The passive voice＿⟯ can equivalently be said to make ⟮＿the subject＿⟯ into ⟮＿a patient＿⟯.

##### middle

»⟮The middle voice⟯« is ⟮＿a passivelike voice＿⟯ where ⟮A1⟯ is ⟮both ＿the agent＿ and ＿the patient＿⟯.
»⟮The mediopassive voice⟯« is ⟮＿a grammatical voice＿⟯ that ⟮merges ＿the middle voice＿ and ＿the passive voice＿⟯.

#### valency = 1

»⟮The impersonal passive voice⟯« is ⟮the only ＿passivelike voice＿⟯ which applies to ⟮＿monovalent verbs＿⟯.
»⟮The impersonal passive voice⟯« ⟮＿demotes＿⟯ ⟮the only remaining ＿verbal argument＿ of ＿monovalent verbs＿⟯.
Languoids often achieve an effect similar to ⟮＿the impersonal passive voice＿⟯ by ⟮inserting a ＿dummy element＿⟯.
