# syntax

»⟮Syntax⟯« is the study of how ⟮words and morphemes⟯ ⟮form larger units⟯ such as ⟮phrases and sentences⟯ and thus ⟮give rise to meaning⟯.

## basic structure

### constituents

»⟮A constituent⟯« is ⟮a word or group of words⟯ that ⟮functions as a single unit⟯ and has ⟮tree structure⟯.
⟮The assembly of constitutents⟯ into ⟮larger constituents⟯ allows ⟮the generation the infinite variety of possible sentences⟯ that language is famous for.

#### constituenty tests

⟮＿Constituents＿⟯ are ⟮identified by⟯ using ⟮＿constituent tests＿⟯.
»⟮A constituency test⟯« is ⟮a test⟯ for ⟮identifying ＿constituents＿⟯.
Any given ⟮＿constituency test＿⟯ ⟮may work⟯ ⟮in many different languages⟯, or ⟮c_;only for languages with certain characteristics⟯.

#### phrases

»⟮a phrase⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ which has ⟮＿a head＿⟯, a ⟮＿phrasal category＿⟯ and ⟮acts in a certain way⟯ based ⟮on its ＿phrasal category＿⟯.
»⟮The head⟯« of ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ is ⟮＿the lexical unit＿⟯ ⟮everything else in the phrase is about⟯.
»⟮A dependent⟯« is ⟮any element of ＿a phrase＿⟯ that ⟮isn't ＿the head＿⟯.
»⟮The phrasal category⟯« corresponds to ⟮＿the word class＿⟯ of ⟮＿the head＿⟯.
An ⟮XP⟯ is ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ with ⟮X as ＿its head＿⟯.

### trees

#### direction

Something is »⟮head-inital/head-final⟯« if ⟮＿the head＿⟯ ⟮comes at the beginning/end, respectively⟯.
Something is »⟮left/right-branching⟯« if ⟮their parse trees⟯ ⟮grow to the left/right⟯.
Things that are ⟮＿left/right-branching＿⟯ ⟮are also⟯ ⟮＿head-inital/final＿⟯.

#### annotation

##### labeled bracket

»⟮Labeled bracketing notation⟯« is ⟮a notation⟯ that ⟮can generate⟯ ⟮an arbitrary tree⟯.
⟮＿Labeled bracketing notation＿⟯ is ⟮mostly⟯ used to generate ⟮＿syntax trees＿⟯.
⟮＿Labeled bracketing notation＿⟯: ⟮tree⟯ ::= ⟮[‹nodename›⟯⟮｛ ‹tree›|‹leaf›｝⟯⟮]⟯
⟮leaf⟯ ::= ⟮#somestring⟯

## frameworks

⟮＿Syntax＿⟯ as a field has ⟮many competing⟯ ⟮theories and frameworks⟯.

### generative semantics

⟮＿Generative semantics＿⟯ was ⟮a response to⟯ ⟮＿generative grammar＿⟯ developed in ⟮the 1960s⟯.
⟮＿the linguistics wars＿⟯ was the conflict between ⟮proponents of⟯ ⟮＿generative grammar＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿generative semantics＿⟯.
⟮＿the four horsemen of the apocalypse＿⟯ were ⟮the proponents of⟯ ⟮＿generative semantics＿⟯ in ⟮＿the linguistics wars＿⟯.
⟮george lakoff⟯ was arguably the most famous ⟮＿horseman of the apocalypse＿⟯.
»⟮Generative semantics⟯« held that ⟮syntactic structures⟯ ⟮arise from⟯ ⟮c-;meanings⟯, ⟮rather than the other way around⟯

### chomskyan

#### dependents

⟮＿Dependents＿⟯ may be ⟮＿arguments＿⟯ or ⟮＿modifiers＿⟯.
⟮＿Arguments＿/＿modifiers＿⟯ are ⟮necessary/optional⟯ for ⟮＿the phrase＿⟯ to be ⟮＿grammatical＿⟯
⟮＿Arguments＿⟯ may be ⟮＿complements＿⟯ or ⟮＿specifiers＿⟯.
»⟮The complement⟯« is ⟮＿the argument＿⟯ that ⟮appears closest (in the tree)⟯ to ⟮＿the head＿⟯.
»⟮Specifiers⟯« are ⟮all ＿arguments＿⟯ that ⟮aren't ＿complements＿⟯.
⟮modifier⟯ =syn= ⟮adjunct⟯.
⟮Adjoining adjuncts⟯ creates ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿phrasal category＿ as it originally was⟯.
^Ergo adjoining something to a YP results in a larger YP.
⟮Adjunction⟯ can be ⟮recursive⟯.
⟮The generative grammar/chomskyan approach⟯ is to see ⟮＿the object＿⟯ as ⟮the DP ＿complement＿ of a verb⟯.

#### X-bar theory

flex-container:✫x-bar-schema-basic.jpg✫


»⟮The X-bar theory⟯« is the claim that ⟮all ＿phrases＿ follow⟯ ⟮＿the X-bar schema＿⟯.

##### !In the X-bar schema...

⟮each node⟯ is ⟮binary, i.e. has two children.⟯
⟮＿arguments＿⟯ are ⟮necessary⟯ but ⟮may be empty⟯.
The difference between ⟮＿complements＿ and ＿specifiers＿⟯ is that ⟮＿the complement＿⟯ is ⟮a sister node to X⟯, while ⟮c-;＿the specifier＿⟯ is ⟮a sister node to X'⟯.

##### in terms of projections

In the X-bar schema, ⟮XP⟯ is theoretically ⟮X''⟯.
In the X-bar schema, ⟮X'⟯ and ⟮c_;X'' (XP)⟯ are »⟮projections⟯« of ⟮X⟯.


table:symbol|projection description
⟮X⟯|⟮the minimum projection of X⟯
⟮X'⟯|⟮neither the minimum nor the maximum projection of X⟯
⟮X''/XP⟯|⟮the maximum projection of X⟯

#### certain phrases/hypotheses

##### CP

⟮C⟯ = ⟮Complementizer⟯
[»⟮CP⟯« ⟮[C]⟯ ⟮[IP]⟯]

»⟮A complement clause⟯« is ⟮＿a CP＿⟯ that is ⟮＿a clause＿⟯. 
^I think this is all CPs, but not sure
⟮＿Interrogative clauses＿⟯ are often seen as ⟮＿CPs＿⟯.

##### IP theory

⟮I⟯ as a head is short for ⟮inflection⟯.
»⟮the IP theory⟯« is that ⟮＿the sentence＿⟯ is ⟮an IP⟯
^The argument for I as the head of the sentence goes something like: It makes sense for a sentence to be a type of phrase and has a head, inflectional information is core to a sentence, so it makes sense for that to be the head.
under ⟮＿the IP theory＿⟯, ⟮＿the subject＿⟯ is the thing that is ⟮in ＿the specifier＿ of the IP⟯.
under ⟮＿the IP theory＿⟯, ⟮＿the complement＿⟯ of ⟮I⟯ is ⟮the main VP⟯.

###### illustration

!class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin

###### auxiliaries

In the IP theory, generally auxiliaries (at least in english) are treated as if they live in the I position.
However, assuming multiple auxiliaries as part of one I head does not work, as we can insert things such as adverbs between them.
So, auxiliaries probably all start out as V heads.
The top auxiliary (in the tree) moves from V to I.
Multiple auxiliaries are adjoined as Vs to the VP.

##### VP-internal subject hypothesis

According to the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject DP starts out in the VP, and them moves to the specifier of the IP later.
According to the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject DP will not move from the specifier of the VP to the specifier of the IP if the specifier of the IP is already filled by an expletive subject.

###### motivation

The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it makes the VP consistent with the X-bar schema.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it makes the subject which is semantically an argument of the V also grammatically an argument of the V.
The VP-internal subject hypothesis is desirable because it lets us address some discontinuities, especially in relation to adverbs.
Evidence: The subject is an argument of the V, but it appears outside of the VP, closer to I than to V.

##### DP hypothesis: 

The DP hypothesis claims that what are commonly assumed to be NPs are actuall DPs headed by a D.
The DP hypothesis argues that D can be seen as the head of a DP since the D picks out the referent, and everything, including the noun, then merely describes the D.
Intuitively, the head of "the best student of physics" seems to be "student", but the DP hypothesis claims its "the".

###### motivation

Part of the motivation for the DP hypothesis is that pronouns seem to be NPs without an actual N head.
The DP hypothesis is still a controversial hypothesis.
The DP hypothesis often correlates with the idea that pronouns are determiners.
In the DP hypothesis, a determinerless noun has a silent/unpronounced D.

## phenomena

### expletives

An ⟮expletive⟯ is a ⟮meaningless⟯ element put in some position to ⟮fulfil a grammatical requirement⟯. 
Expletitives are generally lexemes with other usual functions which are drained of their semantic contents for the purpose of acting as an expletive.
^E.g. ⁑There⁑ is someone helping us here. ⁑It⁑ was raining, wasn't ⁑it⁑?

### movement

A discontinuity is when two parts of a constituent are separated by an element that is not part of the constituent.
Syntactic movement is the explanation of discontinuities via movement within the posited syntax tree.
Syntactic movement is only used by some grammatical theories, and remains controversial.
Something is "in situ" if it doesn't move, although it normally would.

#### fronting

Fronting something is moving it to the front of the sentence

#### traces

In chomskyian theories, movement leaves behind an empty category called a trace.
Traces are symbolized by `t`.
Co-indexing is marking the trace and the thing that moved with a subscript index/letter.
Amongst the evidence for the existence of traces is that we can't contract over them.

#### types of movement

Two types of movement often distinguished are phrasal and head movement.

##### phrasal movement

phrasal movement is syntactic movement of a phrase.

##### head movement

Head movement is the syntactic movement of a head.
Head movement will leave behind any dependents as-is.
Whatever-stranding is head movement that leaves behind a dependent whatever.
Pied-piping is phrasal movement instead of head movement to prevent a dependent being left behind.

###### head movement constraint

The Head Movement Constraint (HMC) is the rule that a head H can only move to a position occupied by the head which selects HP as its complement.
The HMC is a proposed rule in generative grammar.
Due to the HMC, the only way a constiutent can move to a position that isn't selecting HP as its complement is via stepwise movement.
The head movement contraint only applies to head movement, obv.
According to the HMC, I can only move to a position that selects IP as its complement.

### having/not having content

»⟮An empty category⟯« is ⟮a head/phrase⟯ that is ⟮＿unpronounced＿⟯.
Something is »⟮unpronounced⟯« if ⟮it doesn't have any phonological realization (not even silence)⟯.
»⟮An overt category⟯« is ⟮a head/phrase⟯ that is ⟮not an ＿empty category＿⟯.
⟮＿An empty category＿⟯ is often indicated by ⟮ø⟯ or ⟮＊e＊⟯
