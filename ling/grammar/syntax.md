# syntax

»⟮Syntax⟯« is the study of how ⟮words and morphemes⟯ ⟮form larger units⟯ such as ⟮phrases and sentences⟯ and thus ⟮give rise to meaning⟯.

## basic structure

### constituents

»⟮A constituent⟯« is ⟮a word or group of words⟯ that ⟮functions as a single unit⟯ and has ⟮tree structure⟯.
⟮The assembly of constitutents⟯ into ⟮larger constituents⟯ allows ⟮the generation the infinite variety of possible sentences⟯ that language is famous for.

#### constituenty tests

⟮＿Constituents＿⟯ are ⟮identified by⟯ using ⟮＿constituent tests＿⟯.
»⟮A constituency test⟯« is ⟮a test⟯ for ⟮identifying ＿constituents＿⟯.
Any given ⟮＿constituency test＿⟯ ⟮may work⟯ ⟮in many different languages⟯, or ⟮c_;only for languages with certain characteristics⟯.

#### phrases

»⟮a phrase⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ which has ⟮＿a head＿⟯, a ⟮＿phrasal category＿⟯ and ⟮acts in a certain way⟯ based ⟮on its ＿phrasal category＿⟯.
»⟮The head⟯« of ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ is ⟮＿the lexical unit＿⟯ ⟮everything else in the phrase is about⟯.
»⟮A dependent⟯« is ⟮any element of ＿a phrase＿⟯ that ⟮isn't ＿the head＿⟯.
»⟮The phrasal category⟯« corresponds to ⟮＿the word class＿⟯ of ⟮＿the head＿⟯.
An ⟮XP⟯ is ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ with ⟮X as ＿its head＿⟯.

### trees

#### direction

Something is »⟮head-inital/head-final⟯« if ⟮＿the head＿⟯ ⟮comes at the beginning/end, respectively⟯.
Something is »⟮left/right-branching⟯« if ⟮their parse trees⟯ ⟮grow to the left/right⟯.
Things that are ⟮＿left/right-branching＿⟯ ⟮are also⟯ ⟮＿head-inital/final＿⟯.

#### annotation

##### labeled bracket

»⟮Labeled bracketing notation⟯« is ⟮a notation⟯ that ⟮can generate⟯ ⟮an arbitrary tree⟯.
⟮＿Labeled bracketing notation＿⟯ is ⟮mostly⟯ used to generate ⟮＿syntax trees＿⟯.
⟮＿Labeled bracketing notation＿⟯: ⟮tree⟯ ::= ⟮[‹nodename›⟯⟮｛ ‹tree›|‹leaf›｝⟯⟮]⟯
⟮leaf⟯ ::= ⟮#somestring⟯

## frameworks

⟮＿Syntax＿⟯ as a field has ⟮many competing⟯ ⟮theories and frameworks⟯.

### generative semantics

⟮＿Generative semantics＿⟯ was ⟮a response to⟯ ⟮＿generative grammar＿⟯ developed in ⟮the 1960s⟯.
⟮＿the linguistics wars＿⟯ was the conflict between ⟮proponents of⟯ ⟮＿generative grammar＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿generative semantics＿⟯.
⟮＿the four horsemen of the apocalypse＿⟯ were ⟮the proponents of⟯ ⟮＿generative semantics＿⟯ in ⟮＿the linguistics wars＿⟯.
⟮george lakoff⟯ was arguably the most famous ⟮＿horseman of the apocalypse＿⟯.
»⟮Generative semantics⟯« held that ⟮syntactic structures⟯ ⟮arise from⟯ ⟮c-;meanings⟯, ⟮rather than the other way around⟯

### chomskyan

#### dependents

⟮＿Dependents＿⟯ may be ⟮＿arguments＿⟯ or ⟮＿modifiers＿⟯.
⟮＿Arguments＿/＿modifiers＿⟯ are ⟮necessary/optional⟯ for ⟮＿the phrase＿⟯ to be ⟮＿grammatical＿⟯
⟮＿Arguments＿⟯ may be ⟮＿complements＿⟯ or ⟮＿specifiers＿⟯.
»⟮The complement⟯« is ⟮＿the argument＿⟯ that ⟮appears closest (in the tree)⟯ to ⟮＿the head＿⟯.
»⟮Specifiers⟯« are ⟮all ＿arguments＿⟯ that ⟮aren't ＿complements＿⟯.
⟮modifier⟯ =syn= ⟮adjunct⟯.
⟮Adjoining adjuncts⟯ creates ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯ of ⟮the same ＿phrasal category＿ as it originally was⟯.
^Ergo adjoining something to a YP results in a larger YP.
⟮Adjunction⟯ can be ⟮recursive⟯.
⟮The generative grammar/chomskyan approach⟯ is to see ⟮＿the object＿⟯ as ⟮the DP ＿complement＿ of a verb⟯.

#### X-bar theory

flex-container:✫x-bar-schema-basic.jpg✫


»⟮The X-bar theory⟯« is the claim that ⟮all ＿phrases＿ follow⟯ ⟮＿the X-bar schema＿⟯.

##### !In the X-bar schema...

⟮each node⟯ is ⟮binary, i.e. has two children.⟯
⟮＿arguments＿⟯ are ⟮necessary⟯ but ⟮may be empty⟯.
The difference between ⟮＿complements＿ and ＿specifiers＿⟯ is that ⟮＿the complement＿⟯ is ⟮a sister node to X⟯, while ⟮c-;＿the specifier＿⟯ is ⟮a sister node to X'⟯.

##### in terms of projections

In the X-bar schema, ⟮XP⟯ is theoretically ⟮X''⟯.
In the X-bar schema, ⟮X'⟯ and ⟮c_;X'' (XP)⟯ are »⟮projections⟯« of ⟮X⟯.


table:symbol|projection description
⟮X⟯|⟮the minimum projection of X⟯
⟮X'⟯|⟮neither the minimum nor the maximum projection of X⟯
⟮X''/XP⟯|⟮the maximum projection of X⟯

#### certain phrases/hypotheses

##### IP theory

⟮I⟯ as a head is short for ⟮inflection⟯.
»⟮the IP theory⟯« is that ⟮＿the sentence＿⟯ is ⟮an IP⟯
^The argument for I as the head of the sentence goes something like: It makes sense for a sentence to be a type of phrase and has a head, inflectional information is core to a sentence, so it makes sense for that to be the head.
under ⟮＿the IP theory＿⟯, ⟮＿the subject＿⟯ is the thing that is ⟮in ＿the specifier＿ of the IP⟯.
under ⟮＿the IP theory＿⟯, ⟮＿the complement＿⟯ of ⟮I⟯ is ⟮the main VP⟯.

###### illustration

table:headerrows=0,,,!class=blank-canvas;span=3;class=inner;⟮IP⟯
!class=inner;⟮NP⟯     |span=2;class=inner;⟮I'⟯
!class=inner;       |class=inner;⟮I⟯     |class=inner;⟮VP⟯
!class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin|class=leaf;somethin

###### !auxiliaries in the IP theory

In the basic ⟮＿IP theory＿⟯, generally ⟮＿auxiliaries＿⟯ (at least in english) are treated as if ⟮they live in the I position⟯.
However, assuming multiple auxiliaries as part of one I head does not work, as we can insert things such as adverbs between them.
So, ⟮＿auxiliaries＿⟯ probably all ⟮start out⟯ as ⟮V heads⟯ ⟮＿adjoined＿⟯ to ⟮the main VP⟯.
The ⟮top auxiliary (in the tree)⟯ ⟮moves from V to I⟯.

##### VP-internal subject hypothesis

»⟮The VP-internal subject hypothesis⟯« is that ⟮the subject DP⟯ ⟮starts out in the VP⟯, and ⟮then moves to the specifier of the IP later⟯.
According to the ⟮＿VP-internal subject hypothesis＿⟯, ⟮the subject DP⟯ ⟮will not move from the specifier of the VP to the specifier of the IP⟯ if ⟮the specifier of the IP is already filled by an expletive subject⟯.

###### motivation

⟮＿The VP-internal subject hypothesis＿⟯ is desirable because ⟮it makes the VP consistent⟯ with ⟮＿the X-bar schema＿⟯.
⟮＿The VP-internal subject hypothesis＿⟯ is desirable because it makes ⟮＿the subject＿⟯, which ⟮is semantically an argument of the V⟯, ⟮also grammatically an argument of the V⟯.
⟮＿The VP-internal subject hypothesis＿⟯ is desirable because it lets us address some ⟮＿discontinuities＿⟯, especially in relation to adverbs.

##### DP hypothesis: 

»⟮The DP hypothesis⟯« claims that ⟮what are commonly assumed to be NPs⟯ are ⟮actually DPs headed by a D⟯.
The DP hypothesis is still ⟮controversial⟯.

###### details

In ⟮＿the DP hypothesis＿⟯, a ⟮determinerless⟯ noun ⟮has an unpronounced D⟯.
⟮＿The DP hypothesis＿⟯ often ⟮implies⟯ ⟮＿the pronouns-are-determiners hypothesis＿⟯

###### justification

Under ⟮＿the DP hypothesis＿⟯, semantically ⟮D⟯ is ⟮picking out the referent⟯, and ⟮everything else, including the noun,⟯ is ⟮describing that referent⟯.
^Intuitively, the head of "the best student of physics" seems to be "student", but the DP hypothesis claims its "the".

###### !motivation

⟮＿Pronouns＿⟯ seem to be ⟮NPs⟯ ⟮without an actual N head⟯.

## phenomena

### expletives

»⟮An expletive⟯« is ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ that is ⟮semantically vacuous⟯.
»⟮A syntactic expletive⟯« is ⟮＿an expletive＿⟯ that is there to ⟮fill a position⟯.
^E.g. ⁑There⁑ is someone helping us here. ⁑It⁑ was raining, wasn't ⁑it⁑?
»⟮Expletification⟯« (my term) is ⟮the draining of meaning from⟯ ⟮＿lexical units＿⟯ to ⟮make them expletives⟯. 

### movement

»⟮A discontinuity⟯« is ⟮two parts⟯ of ⟮＿a constituent＿⟯ ⟮being separated⟯ by ⟮an element that is not part of ＿the constituent＿⟯.
»⟮Syntactic movement⟯« is ⟮the movement of ＿a constituent＿⟯ ⟮c_;from⟯ ⟮their original place in the syntax tree⟯ ⟮c_-;to⟯ ⟮other places⟯.
⟮＿Syntactic movement＿⟯ aims to ⟮explain/predict⟯ ⟮＿discontinuities＿⟯.
^Syntactic movement is only used by some grammatical theories, and remains controversial.
Something »⟮in situ⟯« ⟮doesn't move, although it normally would.⟯

#### fronting

»⟮Fronting⟯« is ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ ⟮to the front of the sentence⟯.

#### traces

»⟮A trace⟯« is ⟮＿an empty category＿⟯ ⟮left behind by ＿syntactic movement＿⟯.
In chomskyian theories, ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ ⟮always⟯ ⟮leaves ＿a trace＿⟯.
⟮＿Traces＿⟯ are symbolized by ⟮`t`⟯.
»⟮Co-indexing⟯« is ⟮marking⟯ ⟮＿the trace＿⟯ and ⟮c_;the thing that moved⟯ ⟮with a subscript index/letter⟯.

##### evidence

we can't contract over traces.

#### types of movement

⟮＿Syntactic movement＿⟯ may be ⟮＿phrasal movement＿⟯ or ⟮＿head movement＿⟯.

##### phrasal movement

»⟮phrasal movement⟯« is ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ of ⟮＿a phrase＿⟯.

##### head movement

»⟮Head movement⟯« is ⟮＿syntactic movement＿⟯ of ⟮＿a head＿⟯.
»⟮dependent stranding⟯« (my term) is ⟮＿head movement＿⟯ that ⟮leaves behind a dependent⟯.
⟮＿Head movement＿⟯ will ⟮always⟯ ⟮result in ＿dependent stranding＿⟯ if ⟮c_-;there are any dependents⟯
»⟮Pied-piping⟯« is ⟮＿phrasal movement＿ instead of ＿head movement＿⟯ to ⟮prevent ＿dependent stranding＿⟯.

###### head movement constraint

»⟮The Head Movement Constraint⟯« is the rule that ⟮＿a head＿ H⟯ ⟮can only move to⟯ a position which ⟮selects HP as its complement⟯.
Under ⟮＿the HMC＿⟯, the only way ⟮c_;＿the HMC＿⟯ can be '⟮skirted⟯' is via ⟮stepwise movement⟯.
⟮＿The head movement contraint＿⟯ ⟮only applies⟯ to ⟮＿head movement＿⟯, obv.

### having/not having content

»⟮An empty category⟯« is ⟮a head/phrase⟯ that is ⟮＿unpronounced＿⟯.
Something is »⟮unpronounced⟯« if ⟮it doesn't have any phonological realization (not even silence)⟯.
»⟮An overt category⟯« is ⟮a head/phrase⟯ that is ⟮not an ＿empty category＿⟯.
⟮＿An empty category＿⟯ is often indicated by ⟮ø⟯ or ⟮＊e＊⟯
