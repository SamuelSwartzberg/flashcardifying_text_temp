### numeral system 

»⟮A numeral system⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ using ⟮＿numerals＿⟯ to ⟮represent ＿numbers＿.⟯

#### numbers

»⟮A numeral⟯« is ⟮a set of ＿digits＿⟯ ⟮representing ＿a number＿⟯.
»⟮a digit⟯« is a ⟮single⟯ ⟮＿grapheme＿⟯ representing ⟮a numeric value⟯ ⟮smaller than⟯ ⟮＿the base＿⟯.

#### positional

»⟮A positional numeral system⟯« is one where ⟮the value⟯ of ⟮＿the numeral＿⟯ is ⟮the sum of⟯ ⟮the value of all ＿the digits＿⟯, and ⟮c_-3;the value⟯ of ⟮＿a digit＿⟯ is ⟮digit * ⟯⟮base⎴index of position⎴⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ is ⟮0⟯ for ⟮the rightmost position.⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ ⟮increases by 1⟯ ⟮going further to the left⟯.
»⟮Positional notation⟯« is ⟮writing ＿a number＿⟯ ⟮using ＿a positional numeral system＿⟯.
⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ can display ⟮＿any real number＿⟯, though ⟮some will always⟯ have ⟮repeating digits⟯ (depending on the system)

##### digits

There are ⟮b-1⟯ ⟮unique digits⟯ in ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ with ⟮＿a base＿ b⟯.
The ⟮＿digits＿⟯ of ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ form ⟮a series⟯ such that ⟮they increase in value by 1⟯ starting ⟮from 0⟯.

##### operation

In ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯, once ⟮a certain digit⟯ ⟮has reached its maximum value⟯ and ⟮one more is added⟯, ⟮the digit is reset⟯ and⟮ one is added⟯ ⟮to the digit on the left⟯.

##### names of positional numeral systems

Different ⟮＿positional numeral systems＿⟯ have ⟮names⟯ depending on their ⟮＿base＿⟯.


table:positional numeral system|base
»⟮Binary⟯«|⟮2⟯
»⟮Octal⟯«|⟮8⟯
»⟮Decimal⟯«|⟮10⟯
»⟮Hexadecimal⟯«|⟮16⟯
»⟮Vigesimal⟯«|⟮20⟯

##### properties

###### endianness

»⟮Endianness⟯« is ⟮the order⟯ of ⟮＿most/least significant byte＿⟯ relative to ⟮the memory adress⟯.
⟮＿Endianness＿⟯ may be ⟮＿big＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿little-endian＿⟯.

»the ⟮least/most⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯« is the byte that ⟮has the highest base⟯
»⟮big/little⟯⟮-endian⟯« is if ＿the ⟮most/least⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯＿ is at ⟮the smallest memory address⟯.

If we write memory addresses from left to right, as is usual, then arabic numerals would be big endian.

⟮Modern processors⟯ are all ⟮＿little-endian＿⟯
⟮the internet⟯ is ⟮＿big-endian＿⟯.

###### largest numbers

⟮the largest possible number⟯ in a number of ⟮n digits⟯ of ⟮a given positional numeral system⟯ is ⟮base^n - 1⟯


table:system|largest number
⟮8-bit binary⟯|⟮255⟯

##### fractions

###### radix point

»⟮The radix point⟯« is ⟮＿a grapheme＿⟯ that separates the point in a positional numeral system where ⟮＿the index of position＿ (and thus value of the exponent)⟯ ⟮goes negative⟯.
⟮＿The radix point＿⟯ is usually written as ⟮a `.`⟯ in ⟮english⟯.
»⟮the decimal separator⟯« is ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯ when ⟮using the ＿decimal＿ ＿positional numeral system＿.⟯

###### repeating numbers

⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ has real numbers which it can only display as ⟮repeating numbers⟯.
⟮Which⟯ numbers must be displayed as repeating numbers depends on ⟮the base⟯ of the  positional numeral system.
»⟮the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem⟯« (my term) is that certain ⟮fractional numbers⟯ on computers may ⟮produce surprising results⟯.
⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯ stems from the fact that ⟮binary⟯ is used to ⟮store the numbers⟯, but ⟮c-;decimal⟯ is used to ⟮write them in source code⟯.
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, what ⟮the computer sees⟯ is ⟮0.00011 0011... + 0.0011... = ...⟯
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, the constituent numbers are ⟮repeating⟯ in ⟮binary⟯, so ⟮it is not surprsing that they could not be added⟯.

##### exponent-based notation

»⟮Exponential notation⟯« (has variant definitions that I don't care about) is a notation ⟮based on⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral notation＿⟯ that modifies the behavior of ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ used as ⟮c_;an exponent⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ or ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯.
»⟮Fixed-point notation⟯« is ⟮non⟯-⟮＿floating point notation＿⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ ⟮splits⟯ ⟮＿a numeral＿⟯ into »⟮a significand⟯« and »⟮an exponent factor⟯«, ⟮c-3;connected⟯ via ⟮multiplication⟯.
⟮＿The exponent factor＿⟯ of ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯ has the form ⟮base⎴n⎴⟯.
In ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯, the way ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ is modified is that ⟮a part of⟯ ⟮c_-;＿the index of position＿⟯ is ⟮extracted into⟯ ⟮the exponent⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯, ⟮the exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮is kept between 1 and 10⟯.
⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ may use⟮ e‹n›⟯ instead of ⟮*10^‹n›⟯ to render ⟮＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯, t⟮he exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮does not contain ＿a radix point＿⟯.

###### floating-point

⟮＿Floating-point notation＿⟯ can equivalently be said to store ⟮the position of⟯ ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯, whence ⟮its name⟯.
Since the exponent in effect ⟮stores the position of ＿the radix point＿⟯, ⟮＿the significant＿⟯ itself is implicitly ⟮an integer⟯.
TODO, skipped:
Since the base of a floating-point number is implied, it can be stored as merely two numbers, significand and exponent. (with the connection implied)

####### effects

Floating-point must be used to store what would otherwise be numbers with a radix point, but also allows for storing very large numbers (since the size can be stored as increases in exponent).
floating point operations per second  = FLOPS
FLOPS is a measure of computing performance

###### in programming

in programming, ⟮＿the positional numeral system＿⟯ used is often indicated by ⟮a prefix⟯ starting with ⟮0⟯.
⟮0b⟯ as a prefix pretty much always indicates ⟮binary⟯.
Depending on the ⟮programming language⟯ or ⟮c_;mode⟯, ⟮0⟯ or ⟮c_;0o⟯ as a prefix indicates ⟮octal⟯.
There has been a movement to ⟮0o⟯ as a prefix for ⟮octal⟯ numbers to ⟮prevent errors⟯.

# geometry

## analytic

»⟮analytic geometry⟯« is the study of ⟮＿geometry＿⟯ ⟮using a coordinate system⟯.

### coordinate sys

»⟮A coordinate system⟯« is a system which allows the use of an n-tuple of coordinates to determine the position of a point.
A coordinate is a number that specifies (part of) a position relative to a coordinate system.

#### cartesian

flex-container:✫sm_212px-Coordinate_with_Origin.svg.png✫
A cartesian corrdinate system is a coordinate system where a point is specified by a 2-tuple of cartesian coordinates.
A point in a cartesian coordnate system is specified by a 2-tuple of cartesian coordiantes.
A cartesian coordinate is a coordiante specifies the distance from a cartesian axis.
The two cartesian axes are lines which meet perpendicularly at a point.
The origin is the point where the cartesian axes meet.

## angle

flex-container:✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Two_rays_and_one_vertex.png✫

An angle is the figure between two rays sharing a common endpoint.
The vertex of an angle is the common endpoint of the rays.
The measure of an angle is defined by the ratio between the length of its circular arc to its radius.
^To get the circular arc of an angle, one needs to chose an arbitrary point on one of the rays. The distance of that point to the vertex of the angle is the radius, and the circular arc is that arc that maps this point onto the other ray while preserving the radius.
The measure of an angle is often also called an angle.
A dihedral angle is the angle formed by the intersection of two planes at a line.

### kinds

»⟮An obtuse angle⟯« is an angle with ⟮＿a measure＿⟯ ⟮greater than 90° and smaller than 180°⟯
»⟮An acute angle⟯« is an angle with ⟮＿a measure＿⟯ ⟮smaller than 90°⟯

## measure

»⟮A measure⟯« is ⟮an indication of the size⟯ of something.
