### numeral system 

»⟮A numeral system⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ using ⟮＿numerals＿⟯ to ⟮represent ＿numbers＿.⟯

#### numbers

»⟮A numeral⟯« is ⟮a set of ＿digits＿⟯ ⟮representing ＿a number＿⟯.
»⟮a digit⟯« is a ⟮single⟯ ⟮＿grapheme＿⟯ representing ⟮a numeric value⟯ ⟮smaller than⟯ ⟮＿the base＿⟯.

#### positional

»⟮A positional numeral system⟯« is one where ⟮the value⟯ of ⟮＿the numeral＿⟯ is ⟮the sum of⟯ ⟮the value of all ＿the digits＿⟯, and ⟮c_-3;the value⟯ of ⟮＿a digit＿⟯ is ⟮digit * ⟯⟮base⎴index of position⎴⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ is ⟮0⟯ for ⟮the rightmost position.⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ ⟮increases by 1⟯ ⟮going further to the left⟯.
»⟮Positional notation⟯« is ⟮writing ＿a number＿⟯ ⟮using ＿a positional numeral system＿⟯.
⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ can display ⟮＿any real number＿⟯, though ⟮some will always⟯ have ⟮repeating digits⟯ (depending on the system)

##### digits

There are ⟮b-1⟯ ⟮unique digits⟯ in ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ with ⟮＿a base＿ b⟯.
The ⟮＿digits＿⟯ of ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ form ⟮a series⟯ such that ⟮they increase in value by 1⟯ starting ⟮from 0⟯.

##### operation

In ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯, once ⟮a certain digit⟯ ⟮has reached its maximum value⟯ and ⟮one more is added⟯, ⟮the digit is reset⟯ and⟮ one is added⟯ ⟮to the digit on the left⟯.

##### names of positional numeral systems

Different ⟮＿positional numeral systems＿⟯ have ⟮names⟯ depending on their ⟮＿base＿⟯.


table:positional numeral system|base
»⟮Binary⟯«|⟮2⟯
»⟮Octal⟯«|⟮8⟯
»⟮Decimal⟯«|⟮10⟯
»⟮Hexadecimal⟯«|⟮16⟯
»⟮Vigesimal⟯«|⟮20⟯

##### properties

###### endianness

»⟮Endianness⟯« is ⟮the order⟯ of ⟮＿most/least significant byte＿⟯ relative to ⟮the memory adress⟯.
⟮＿Endianness＿⟯ may be ⟮＿big＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿little-endian＿⟯.

»the ⟮least/most⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯« is the byte that ⟮has the highest base⟯
»⟮big/little⟯⟮-endian⟯« is if ＿the ⟮most/least⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯＿ is at ⟮the smallest memory address⟯.

If we write memory addresses from left to right, as is usual, then arabic numerals would be big endian.

⟮Modern processors⟯ are all ⟮＿little-endian＿⟯
⟮the internet⟯ is ⟮＿big-endian＿⟯.

###### largest numbers

⟮the largest possible number⟯ in a number of ⟮n digits⟯ of ⟮a given positional numeral system⟯ is ⟮base^n - 1⟯


table:system|largest number
⟮8-bit binary⟯|⟮255⟯

##### fractions

###### radix point

»⟮The radix point⟯« is ⟮＿a grapheme＿⟯ that separates the point in a positional numeral system where ⟮＿the index of position＿ (and thus value of the exponent)⟯ ⟮goes negative⟯.
⟮＿The radix point＿⟯ is usually written as ⟮a `.`⟯ in ⟮english⟯.
»⟮the decimal separator⟯« is ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯ when ⟮using the ＿decimal＿ ＿positional numeral system＿.⟯

###### repeating numbers

⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ has real numbers which it can only display as ⟮repeating numbers⟯.
⟮Which⟯ numbers must be displayed as repeating numbers depends on ⟮the base⟯ of the  positional numeral system.
»⟮the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem⟯« (my term) is that certain ⟮fractional numbers⟯ on computers may ⟮produce surprising results⟯.
⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯ stems from the fact that ⟮binary⟯ is used to ⟮store the numbers⟯, but ⟮c-;decimal⟯ is used to ⟮write them in source code⟯.
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, what ⟮the computer sees⟯ is ⟮0.00011 0011... + 0.0011... = ...⟯
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, the constituent numbers are ⟮repeating⟯ in ⟮binary⟯, so ⟮it is not surprsing that they could not be added⟯.

##### exponent-based notation

»⟮Exponential notation⟯« (has variant definitions that I don't care about) is a notation ⟮based on⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral notation＿⟯ that modifies the behavior of ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ used as ⟮c_;an exponent⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ or ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯.
»⟮Fixed-point notation⟯« is ⟮non⟯-⟮＿floating point notation＿⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ ⟮splits⟯ ⟮＿a numeral＿⟯ into »⟮a significand⟯« and »⟮an exponent factor⟯«, ⟮c-3;connected⟯ via ⟮multiplication⟯.
⟮＿The exponent factor＿⟯ of ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯ has the form ⟮base⎴n⎴⟯.
In ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯, the way ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ is modified is that ⟮a part of⟯ ⟮c_-;＿the index of position＿⟯ is ⟮extracted into⟯ ⟮the exponent⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯, ⟮the exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮is kept between 1 and 10⟯.
⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ may use⟮ e‹n›⟯ instead of ⟮*10^‹n›⟯ to render ⟮＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯, t⟮he exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮does not contain ＿a radix point＿⟯.

###### floating-point

⟮＿Floating-point notation＿⟯ can equivalently be said to store ⟮the position of⟯ ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯, whence ⟮its name⟯.
Since the exponent in effect ⟮stores the position of ＿the radix point＿⟯, ⟮＿the significant＿⟯ itself is implicitly ⟮an integer⟯.
TODO, skipped:
Since the base of a floating-point number is implied, it can be stored as merely two numbers, significand and exponent. (with the connection implied)

####### effects

Floating-point must be used to store what would otherwise be numbers with a radix point, but also allows for storing very large numbers (since the size can be stored as increases in exponent).
floating point operations per second  = FLOPS
FLOPS is a measure of computing performance

## angle

flex-container:✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Two_rays_and_one_vertex.png✫

An angle is the figure between two rays sharing a common endpoint.
The vertex of an angle is the common endpoint of the rays.
The measure of an angle is defined by the ratio between the length of its circular arc to its radius.
^To get the circular arc of an angle, one needs to chose an arbitrary point on one of the rays. The distance of that point to the vertex of the angle is the radius, and the circular arc is that arc that maps this point onto the other ray while preserving the radius.
The measure of an angle is often also called an angle.
A dihedral angle is the angle formed by the intersection of two planes at a line.

### kinds

An obtuse angle is an angle with a measure greater than 90° and smaller than 180°
An acute angle is an angle with a measure smaller than 90°

## measure

A measure is the indication of the size of something.

### multiplication

#### multiple

A multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer.
I.e. b is a multiple of a if there is an `n ∈ ℤ` such that `b = na`
a is a submultiple of b means b is a multiple of a.
I.e. a is a submultiple of b if there is an `n ∈ ℤ` such that `b/n = a`

#### basics

In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, numbers are stacked vertically, right aligned, separated from the result by a horizontal bar
In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, addition is done of individual digits from right to left, with carries or borrows as necessary.

#### subtraction

If while doing subtraction by hand, if the subtrahend is bigger than the minuend in any collumn, you need to borrow one from the left.

#### borrows and carries

A carry is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b + 1
A borrow is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b - 1
a borrow is the oposite of a carry.

## integer composition and decomposition

### factorization

⟮Integer factorization⟯ is the ⟮decomposition⟯ of a composite number into ⟮a product of factors⟯.
Both the composite number and factors are integers.
The factors of the composite numbers must be smaller than the number.
a composite number is the product of two or more factors
any positive integer › 1 is either a composite number or a prime number.
factor(s) → composite number is trivial
composite number → factor(s) (integer factorization) has no known efficient algorithm
Thus, integer factorization is essential to most modern cryptography.

#### prime

Prime factorization is a subtype of integer factorization.
Prime factorization is the decomposition of an integer into a product of prime numbers.
Generating composite numbers is trivial, but there is no known efficient algorithm for integer factorization.

### prime number

A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by one and itself (is not a product of two smaller natural numbers)
A semiprime/biprime is a product of exactly two prime numbers.

### formal system

⟮Formal systems⟯ have roughly the following structure:
```
⟮A formal language⟯
⟮An inference system⟯
  ⟮A set of axioms⟯
  ⟮A set of inference rules⟯
⟮A semantics⟯
```

### logics

A ⟮logic⟯ is a ⟮formal system.⟯

#### propositional logic

The ⟮elements of the alphabet⟯ of ⟮a propositional logic⟯ are the ⟮propositional constants⟯, ⟮propositional variables⟯, and ⟮logical connectives⟯. 

##### terminology

⟮Propositional logic⟯ may also be called propositional calculus.
Propositional logic may also be called 0th-order logic, based on its relationship to 1st order logic.
More rarely, propositional logic is called statement logic or sentential calculus/logic.
I will shorten propositional logic to proplog.

##### propositions

A proposition is the thing that bears truth value.
A proposition may be atomic or compound.
An atomic proposition is a proposition that cannot be further analyzed into constituent propositions (in the given logic).
A compound proposition is a propositon that can be further analyzed into constituent propositions (in the given logic.)

##### proposition containers

Proposition containers express/denote propositions.
Proposition containers are either propositional constants, variables and formulas.

###### variables and constants

A propositional variable is a thing that expresses any possible atomic proposition.
A propositional constant is a thing that expresses a specific atomic proposition.

####### typographic conventions

propositional constants are written in lowercase letters starting at p.
In Germany, propositional variables are written in uppercase letters starting at A
In the anglosphere, propositional variables are written in lowercase letters starting at ϕ.

###### propositional formulas

A propositional formula expresses a compound proposition (however, perhaps only one that can be analyzed into a single atomic proposition.).
A propositional formula is a well-formed formula of elements of the alphabet of propositional logic.
A propositional formula may only have length 1, therefore all propositional constants and variables are themselves propositional formulae.
A propositional formula may also be called sentence.

###### example

!Assume an universe in which only the atomic propositions "Sam is awesome" and "Sam is cute" exist.
"Sam is awesome" and "Sam is cute" is a compound proposition.
!If we say "Sam is awesome"/"Sam is cute" is represented by the propositonal constants p/q.
`p`, `p ∨ p`, `q`, `p ∧ q`, `p ∧ q ∧ q ∧ q` is are all propositional formulae.
`p ∧ p ∨ q` would be a propositional formula expressing the compound proposition `"Sam is awesome" and "Sam is awesome" or "Sam is cute"`
A propositonal variable ϕ could either be "Sam is awesome" or "Sam is cute".

##### truth-functionality

A formula is truth-functional if its truth depends only on the truth or truth-functionality of the constituent parts.

##### derived things

###### inference rule

⟮Rule of inference⟯ = ⟮inference rule⟯
A inference rule is a function from sets of formulae to other formulae.

###### arguments

## algebraic structure

For edification, but not currently study material:
In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 

## functions

»⟮A function⟯« ⟮assigns⟯ ⟮an element of⟯ »⟮the codomain⟯« ⟮c-2;to⟯ ⟮each element of⟯ »⟮the domain⟯«. 
^this however does not imply that each element of the codomain is assigned to an element of the domain, there may be unassignemd elements
»⟮An argument⟯« is a value that ⟮must be provided⟯ to ⟮＿the function＿⟯ to ⟮obtain its result⟯.
»⟮A function⟯« takes ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮＿arguments＿⟯

### arguments, parameters, coefficients, constants

#### arguments, parameters

»⟮A variable⟯« is a placeholder for something that may change.
⟮＿Variables＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿arguments＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿parameters＿⟯.
Often, ⟮variable⟯ is treated as a synonym for ⟮argument⟯ (only), ⟮but this is incorrect⟯.
»⟮An argument⟯« is ⟮＿a variable＿⟯ that is ⟮the input of the function, that if varied produces different outcomes⟯.
»⟮A parameter⟯« is ⟮＿a variable＿⟯ that is ⟮not provided as an input for the function⟯. 
Instead, functions with ⟮＿parameters＿⟯ produce ⟮families of functions⟯, where ⟮varying the parameter⟯ ⟮selects a function from⟯ ⟮c_-2 ;the family of functions⟯.
^By analogy: The speed of a bike depends on how fast one pedals - this is an argument. The speed of a bike also depends on the shape, weight, etc. of the bike - but varying those, you now have a different bike - this is a parameter. Leaving parameters for shape, weight, etc. of a bike undefined defines all possible relations between pedal speed and speed of the bike.
⟮＿The arguments＿⟯ but not ⟮c_;＿the parameters＿⟯ of a function are ⟮listed in f(...)⟯
⟮＿Arguments＿⟯ are typically indicated by ⟮letters starting with x⟯.
⟮＿Parameters＿⟯ are typically indicated by l⟮etters starting with a⟯.

»⟮Operands⟯« are ⟮the input values⟯ of ⟮＿operations＿⟯.
»⟮An operator⟯« is ⟮the symbol signifing⟯ ⟮＿the operation＿⟯.
In `3+4`, ⟮3 and 4⟯ are ⟮＿the operands＿⟯.
