### numeral system 

A numeral system is a writing system using numerals to represent numbers.

#### numbers

A numeral is a set of digits representing a number.
a digit is a single grapheme representing a numeric value smaller than the base.

#### positional

A positional numeral system is one where the value of the numeral is the sum of the value of all the digits, and the value of a digit is digit * base⎴index of position⎴
The index of position in a positional numeral system is 0 for the rightmost position.
The index of position in a positional numeral system increases by 1 going further to the left.
Positional notation is writing a number using a positional numeral system.
Any positional numeral system can display any real numbers, though some have repeating digits (depending on the system)

##### digits

There are b-1 unique digits in a positional numeral system with a base b.
The digits of a positional numeral system form a series such that they increase in value by 1 starting from 0.

##### operation

In a positional numeral system, once a certain digit has reached its maximum value and one more is added, the digit is reset and one is added to the digit on the left.

##### names of positional numeral systems

Different positional numeral systems have different names, depending on their base.


table:positional numeral system|base
Binary|2
Octal|8
Decimal|10
Hexadecimal|16
Vigesimal|20

##### properties

###### endianness

Endianness is the order of most/least significant byte relative to the memory adress.
least significant byte|byte that represents the lowest value
most signifcant byte|byte that represents the highest value

big-endian|most significant byte is at smallest memory address
little-endian|least significant byte is at smallest memory address.

If we write memory addresses from left to right, as is usual, then arabic numerals would be big endian.

Modern processors are all little endian, the internet is big-endian.

###### largest numbers

the largest possible number in a number of n digits of a given positional numeral system is base^n - 1


table:system|largest number
8-bit binary|255

##### fractions

###### radix point

The radix point is a symbol that separates the point in a positional numeral system where the index of position (and thus value of the exponent) goes negative.
The radix point is usually written as a `.` in english.
the decimal separator the radix point when using the decimal positional numeral system.

###### repeating numbers

Any positional numeral system has real numbers which it can only display as repeating numbers.
Which numbers much be displayed as repeating numbers depends on the positional numeral system.
the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem (my term) is that certain mathematical operations on fractional numbers on computers may produce surprising results.
the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem stems from the fact that binary is used to store the numbers, but decimal is used to write them in source code.
in the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem, what the computer sees is 0.00011 0011... + 0.0011... = ...
in the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem, the constituent numbers are repeating in binary, so it is not surprsing that they could not be added.

##### exponent-based notation

Exponential notation (has variant definitions that I don't care about) is a notation based on positional numeral notation that modifies the behavior of the index of position used as an exponent.
Exponential notation may either be scientific notation or floating-point notation.
Fixed-point notation is non-floating point notation.
Exponential notation splits a numeral into a significand and an exponent factor, connected via multiplication.
The exponent factor of exponential notation has the form base⎴n⎴.
In exponential notation, a part of the index of position is extracted into the exponent of the exponent factor.
In scientific notation, the exponent of the exponent factor is chosen such that the significand is kept between 1 and 10.
scientific notation may use e‹n› instead of *10^‹n› to render the exponent factor.
In floating-point notation, the exponent of the exponent factor is chosen such that the significand does not contain a radix point.

###### floating-point

Since in floating-point notation the exponent of the exponent factor is chosen such that the significand does not contain a radix point, equivalently one can say it stores the position of the radix point.
Floating point is called such since storing the exponent is equivalent to storing the position of the radix point.
Since the exponent in effect stores the position of the radix point, the significant itself is implicitly an integer.
Since the base of a floating-point number is implied, it can be stored as merely two numbers, significand and exponent. (with the connection implied)

####### effects

Floating-point must be used to store what would otherwise be numbers with a radix point, but also allows for storing very large numbers (since the size can be stored as increases in exponent).
floating point operations per second  = FLOPS
FLOPS is a measure of computing performance

###### in programming

in programming, the positional numeral system used is often indicated by a prefix.
0b as a prefix pretty much always indicates binary.
Depending on the programming language  or mode, 0 or 0o as a prefix indicates octal.
There has been a movement to 0o as a prefix for octal numbers to prefent errors.

# Geometry

## analytic

analytic geometry = catesian geometry
analytic geometry is the study of geometry using a coordinate system.

### coordinate sys

A coordinate system is a system uses an n-tuple of coordinates to determine the position of a point.
A coordinate is a number that specifies (part of) a position relative to a coordinate system.

#### cartesian

flex-container:✫sm_212px-Coordinate_with_Origin.svg.png✫
A cartesian corrdinate system is a coordinate system where a point is specified by a 2-tuple of cartesian coordinates.
A point in a cartesian coordnate system is specified by a 2-tuple of cartesian coordiantes.
A cartesian coordinate is a coordiante specifies the distance from a cartesian axis.
The two cartesian axes are lines which meet perpendicularly at a point.
The origin is the point where the cartesian axes meet.

## angle

flex-container:✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Two_rays_and_one_vertex.png✫

An angle is the figure between two rays sharing a common endpoint.
The vertex of an angle is the common endpoint of the rays.
The measure of an angle is defined by the ratio between the length of its circular arc to its radius.
^To get the circular arc of an angle, one needs to chose an arbitrary point on one of the rays. The distance of that point to the vertex of the angle is the radius, and the circular arc is that arc that maps this point onto the other ray while preserving the radius.
The measure of an angle is often also called an angle.
A dihedral angle is the angle formed by the intersection of two planes at a line.

### kinds

An obtuse angle is an angle with a measure greater than 90° and smaller than 180°
An acute angle is an angle with a measure smaller than 90°

## measure

A measure is the indication of the size of something.

## shapes

### circle

A circular arc is the arc of a circle between a pair of distinct points.

# number theory

Number theory is the branch of maths concerned with the sudy of integers.
Number theory was/is often also called arithmetic/higher arithmetic.

## properties of integers

### parity

Parity is the property of being even or odd.
Something has a parity of even/odd if it is/is not divisible by two.
A number in a positional numeral system will be even if its final digit is even.

### sign

A number's sign is the property of it being either positive, negative, or zero.
A signed number is a number which can have its sign specified.
In computing a number is signed/unsigned if it can/cannot take on negative values.
A number's sign is represented by a sign graphemes.
The typical sign graphemes are + and -.

#### representation

In computing, a sign grapheme cannot be used to store signed numbers.
In absence of a sign grapheme, three common ways exist to indicate the sign of binary numbers: one's complement, two's complement and sign and maginitude representation.
Today, two's complement is by far the most common way to indicate signedness of integers.

##### sign and magnitude represnetation

The problem with using sign bits is that there is both +0 and -0.
one's complement is the result of performing bitwise NOT on a number.
the two's complement is the one's complement + 1
Sign and maginitude representation is using a sign bit to represent signedness.
A sign bit is an extra bit that says whether a number is positive or negative.
Generally, the most siginificant bit is used as the sign bit.
Generally, for negative numbers, the sign bit is set, for positive numbers it is nunset.

## elementary arithmetic

elementary arithmetic is often just called arithmetic.
elementary arithmetic is the set of the operations {addition, subtraction, multiplication, division}
Any elementary arithmetic operation has a unique name for the 1st and 2nd operand.
The commutative elementary arithmetic operations also have names for either operand, as the order does not matter.

### terminology

table:operation|1st operand|2nd operand|both|result
addition|augend|addend|addend/summand|sum
subtraction|minuend|subtrahend|ø|difference
multiplication|multiplier|multiplicand|factor|product
division|dividend|divisor|ø|quotient

### ops on sequences of numbers

A summation is the sum of a sequence of numbers.
A productation (my term) is the product of a sequence of numbers.
For summations and productations there is a special notation using a large Σ/Π, respectively.
The indexing variable is the bound variable used in Σ/Π-notation.
The indexing variable is sometimes called the index of summation/multiplication.
the indexing variable together with its lower bound/limit is denoted as a subscript of Σ/Π-notation.
the upper bound/limit of the indexing variable is denoted as a superscript of Σ/Π-notation.
The thing on the right of Σ/Π-notation is the element being added/multiplied.

### multiplication

#### multiple

A multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer.
I.e. b is a multiple of a if there is an `n ∈ ℤ` such that `b = na`
a is a submultiple of b means b is a multiple of a.
I.e. a is a submultiple of b if there is an `n ∈ ℤ` such that `b/n = a`
E.g. A foot is a 12 fold multiple of an inch, an inch is a 12-fold submultiple of a foot.

#### multiplicative inverse

multiplicative inverse = reciprocal
The reciprocal of x is the number that multiplied by x yields the multiplicative identity .
the reciprocal of a number x is denoted by x⎴-1⎴.

### division

#### fraction

A fraction consists of a numerator and a denominator.
In the most common notation for fractions, the numerator is displayed above the denominator, separated by a bar.
An algebraic fraction is a fraction whose numerator and/or denominator are expressions.
the reciprocal of a fraction a/b is b/a.

##### unit fraction

An unit fraction is a rational number written as a fraction where the numerator is one and the denominator is a positive integer.

#### commensurability

two real numbers are commensurable if their quotient is a rational number.
all rational numbers are by definition commensurable.

### addition

#### digit sum

The digit sum is the summation of all the digits of a number.
e.g. digit sum of 9045⎵10⎵ = 9 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 18.

### algorithms for

#### terminology

Doing elementary aritmetic manually is known as long x or x by hand.
Doing elementary arithmetic manually is known as schriftlich x in german

#### basics

In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, numbers are stacked vertically, right aligned, separated from the result by a horizontal bar
In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, addition is done of individual digits from right to left, with carries or borrows as necessary.

#### subtraction

If while doing subtraction by hand, if the subtrahend is bigger than the minuend in any collumn, you need to borrow one from the left.

#### borrows and carries

A carry is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b + 1
A borrow is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b - 1
a borrow is the oposite of a carry.

## integer composition and decomposition

### factorization

⟮Integer factorization⟯ is the ⟮decomposition⟯ of a composite number into ⟮a product of factors⟯.
Both the composite number and factors are integers.
The factors of the composite numbers must be smaller than the number.
a composite number is the product of two or more factors
any positive integer › 1 is either a composite number or a prime number.
factor(s) → composite number is trivial
composite number → factor(s) (integer factorization) has no known efficient algorithm
Thus, integer factorization is essential to most modern cryptography.

#### prime

Prime factorization is a subtype of integer factorization.
Prime factorization is the decomposition of an integer into a product of prime numbers.
Generating composite numbers is trivial, but there is no known efficient algorithm for integer factorization.

### prime number

A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by one and itself (is not a product of two smaller natural numbers)
A semiprime/biprime is a product of exactly two prime numbers.

In a venn diagram, each shape represents a set S.
In a venn diagram, all possible overlappings of all shapes are present.
In a venn diagram, an element being within a shape indicates that it is an element of the relevant set, ergo an element being within an overlap indicates that it is in both sets.
In a venn diagram, if an area of overlap has no elements, it is often blacked-out.
In a venn diagram, instead of placing elements, it instead can be used to indicated WFF (TODO check if this is the right term) by highlighting the areas which fall under it.

The ⟮maximum/minimum degree⟯ of ⟮a graph⟯ is ⟮the maximum/minimum degree of all its vertices.⟯ 

### connections

A ⟮regular graph⟯ is a graph where ⟮each vertex⟯ ⟮has the same amount of neighbors⟯.

# analysis

## limits

a limit is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.
lim is an unary operator which gets the limit of an entity.
the limit of a function f(x) as x goes to a certain value c is indicated by lim_{x→c} f(x)
the value of a limit  is indicated L.
Asymptotic analysis is a way of describing limiting behavior by approaching the limit infinitely closely.
If under asymptotic analysis the limit becomes a certain value, it is said to be asymptotically equivalent (or just asymptotic) to that value.
a function f(x) being asymtotically equivalent to a certain limit foo is indicated f(x) ~ foo.
so, for example for f(x) = x^2 + 3x at values of x close to infinity, 3x becomes irrelevant. hence f(x) ~ n^2
The asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as x andor y approach infinity.
The asymptote of a curve is also the tangent to the curve at a point in infinity.
horizontal asymptotes|is horizontal|x tends to infinity
vertical asymptotes|is vertical|y tends to infinity


big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their computational complexity (run time or space requirements) grow as the input size grows
Big O notation looks like O(n). 
Big O notation describes limiting behavior under asymptotic analysis.

## calculus

Calculus is the mathematical study of continous change.

### differential calculus

differential calculus is concerned with rate of change and slopes of curves

#### differentiation

A differentiable function is one whose derivative exists at every point of the domain.
The derivate of a function is the slope/gradient of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point
derivative is ableitung in german.

##### antiderivative

antiderivative = inverse derivative
An antiderivative is a differential function F whose derivative is equal to the original function f.
Antiderivatives satisfy F' = f.

### integral calculus

integral calculus is concerned with the accumulation of quantities and the areas under/between curves.

## real analysis

# algebra

In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 

## functions

A function in math is a relationship between two sets, the domain and the codomain.
A function assigns an element of the codomain to each element of the domain. (this however does not imply that each element of the codomain is aassigned to an element of the domain, there may be unassignemd elements)
functions are most often indicated by the letter f and beyond.
the value a function yields for a given element of the domain x is often denoted by f(x).
The element of the codomain that a function yields for a specific element of the domain x is often represented by y.
The graph of the function is the set of all pairs (x, f(x)) (equivalently: (x,y)).
The graph of a function ccan be used to draw a diagram of it, often confusingly and somewhat improperly also called graph.
The ⟮value(s)⟯ that ⟮must be provided⟯ to a ⟮function⟯ to ⟮obtain its result⟯ is/are known as ⟮the/an argument(s)⟯
A mathematical ⟮function⟯ must take ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮arguments⟯

### notation

f(x) is read 「f of x」 in english
f(x) is read 「f von x」 in german

### sets

the image of a function is the subset of the codomain that represents all values f(x) the function can produce
the image of a subset of x is the subset of the codomain that represents all values f(x) (for the subset of x) the function can produce
the preimage of a function is the subset of the domain that that map onto values that are part of the image.

### jective

injective, surjective, bijective function = injection, surjection, byjection
an injective function maps each x to a distinct f(x), i.e. f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2.
a surjective function has at least one mapping that produces y (for every y, there is an x such that f(x) = y.
a bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective.
In other words, a bijective function maps exactly one element of a set to exactly one element of another set.

### inverse

the inverse of a function f is a function that undoes the operation of f
the inverse of a function f only exists if f is bijective
the inverse of a function f is denoted by f^{-1}

### monotonic

A function is monotonic if for all x_1, x_2: 
montonically increasing|non-decreasing, weakly increasing|x_1 ≤ x_2 also f(x_1) ≤ f(x_2)
strictly (montonically) increasing|increasing|x_1 ‹ x_2 also f(x_1) ‹ f(x_2)
montonically decreasing|non-decreasing, weakly decreasing|x_1 ≤ x_2 also f(x_1) ≥ f(x_2)
strictly (montonically) increasing|increasing|x_1 ‹ x_2 also f(x_1) › f(x_2)

a function is monotonic if it is monotonically increasing or monotonically decresing
a function is strictly monotonic if it is strictly monotonically increasing or stricly monotonically decresing

### zero

Zero = null = root
Nullstelle = zero/null/root
The zero is the point at which the graph of a function touches or intersects with the x-axis
Per definition, any zero x has the property f(x)=0

a ⟮bound variable⟯ on the other hand is ⟮a convenience to express something⟯, that does not ⟮stand for a particular thing⟯
often an expression/statement can be ⟮rephrased⟯ to ⟮eliminate bound variables⟯ (though not always).
in the expression \({\sum _{k=1}^{10}f(k,n),}\) ⟮c+;k is  a bound variable⟯ and ⟮n is a free variable⟯
in the expression \({\lim _{h\rightarrow 0}{\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}},}\) ⟮x is a free variable⟯, ⟮h is a bound variable⟯
There are a few common ⟮variable-binding⟯ operators, most commonly ⟮c+;sum Σ, product Π, integral ∫, limit lim, existential quantifier ∃, universal quantifier ∀⟯

### arguments, parameters, coefficients, constants

A »variable« is a placeholder for something that may change.
Variables may either be arguments or parameters.
Often, variable is treated as a synonym for argument (only), but this is incorrect.
An argument is a variable that is the input of the function, that if varied produces different outcomes.
A parameter is a variable that is not provided as an input for the function. Instead, functions with parameters produce families of functions, where varying the parameter selects a function from the family of functions.
By analogy: The speed of a bike depends on how fast one pedals - this is an argument. The speed of a bike also depends on the shape, weight, etc. of the bike - but varying those, you now have a different bike - this is a parameter. Leaving parameters for shape, weight, etc. of a bike undefined defines all possible relations between pedal speed and speed of the bike.
The ⟮arguments⟯ of a function must ⟮be listed in f(...)⟯, the ⟮parameters⟯ of functions must ⟮under no circumstances be⟯.
⟮Constant⟯ in math is ambiguous: It may refer to ⟮a well-defined and fixed number (e.g. π)⟯, or ⟮is a synonym for ＿parameter＿⟯
A coefficient is something (may be a variable or something that isn't a variable, e.g. an expression, a number) that is multiplied with something else (that thing may be 1).
A constant coefficient is not multiplied with any argument, and may be multiplied with 1.

## Equation

f+o+o = b+a+r
An ⟮equation⟯ is a statement that ⟮asserts the equality⟯ of ⟮two expressions⟯
An ⟮equation⟯ connects its ⟮two⟯ ⟮expressions⟯ via ⟮an equals sign⟯

## terms and expressions

An ⟮expression⟯ in math is ⟮a well-formed combination of mathematical symbols (e.g. numbers, variables, operations, functions, brackets, etc.)⟯ including ⟮at least one operator⟯
a ⟮term⟯ in math is any part of an ⟮expression⟯ that is by itself ⟮well-formed⟯ and ⟮does not contain an operator⟯.

## operations

An operation is a function which takes zero or more input values and produces a well-defined output value.
In an operation, the zero or more input values are known as operands.
In an operation, the symbol performing the operation is an operator.
In 3+4, 3 and 4 are the operands.
In 3+4, + is the operator.
We might want to consider a constant to be an operation of arity 0.

### types

#### elementary

#### non-elementary

##### exponentiation

exponentiation is a mathematical operation which is written as b^n and means \prod_{i=1}^{n}b
For an exponentiation b^n, b is called the base, and n is called exponent.
base ≈ radix
The logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation.
The logarithm of a number x is the exponent n that applied to a given base b would yield x.
If no base is given for a logarithm, it is obvious or doesn't matter.
The logarithm of x for a base b is denoted as \log_b(x) or \log_{b}x
log_b(b^n) = n

log_e = ln
natural logarithm: log_e

b^1 = b
b^0 = 1
b^-n = 1/(b^{-1})


### properties

#### identity element

The identity element is an element of a set that a binary operation operates on.
The identity element is the element of the set that when used with the binary operation will leave every element of the set unchanged.
The identity element of a certain operation is often called that function's identity (ergo e.g. multiplicative identity).
The identity element of multiplication performed on real numbers is 1.
The identity element of addition performed on real numbers is 0.

#### idempotentitcity

A function/operation/etc. is ⟮idempotent⟯ if ⟮it can be applied mulitple times⟯ without ⟮changing the result⟯ ⟮beyond the initial application⟯. 
Examples for i⟮dempotent functions⟯ include ⟮abs(x), floor(x), ceil(x) etc.⟯

#### commutative

A commutative operation is one where changing the order of operands does not change the result.
Addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and dicvision are noncommutative.

#### associative

An associative operation is one where rearranging parenthesis will not change the result.
Addition and multiplication (if not mixed) are associative, subtraction and division are nonassociative.

#### distributive

an operation is distributive if it is both left- and right-distributive
left-distributive|ζ * (x+y) = (ζ * x) + (ζ * y)
right-distributive|(x+y) * ζ = (ζ * x) + (ζ * y)

### arguments


The »arity« of something specifies how many ＿operands＿ or ＿arguments＿ are involved. 
Arity is a property of operations or functions.
arity and adicity are rough synonyms
The arity is specified in latinate numbers
adicity is specified in greek-derived numbers.
adicity: monadic, dyadic, triadic, tetradic, pentadic, hexadic...
there is an adicity for every arity.
A function with an arity of 1 takes one argument.
A ternary operator takes 3 operands.
(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)add has an arity of ⟮4⟯
Something with indefinite arity is called ⟮variadic⟯

A n-ary function takes n arguments.
3+6=9 is a binary operation.
Arity of...|Name
⟮0⟯|⟮nullary⟯
⟮1⟯|⟮unary⟯
⟮2⟯|⟮binary⟯
⟮3⟯|⟮ternary⟯
⟮n⟯|⟮n-ary⟯


#### order

prefix notation|operator before operands|polish notation
postfix notation|operator after operands|reverse polish notation
infix notation|operator between operands

The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924
