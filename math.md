### numeral system 

»⟮A numeral system⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ using ⟮＿numerals＿⟯ to ⟮represent ＿numbers＿.⟯

#### numbers

»⟮A numeral⟯« is ⟮a set of ＿digits＿⟯ ⟮representing ＿a number＿⟯.
»⟮a digit⟯« is a ⟮single⟯ ⟮＿grapheme＿⟯ representing ⟮a numeric value⟯ ⟮smaller than⟯ ⟮＿the base＿⟯.

#### positional

»⟮A positional numeral system⟯« is one where ⟮the value⟯ of ⟮＿the numeral＿⟯ is ⟮the sum of⟯ ⟮the value of all ＿the digits＿⟯, and ⟮c_-3;the value⟯ of ⟮＿a digit＿⟯ is ⟮digit * ⟯⟮base⎴index of position⎴⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ is ⟮0⟯ for ⟮the rightmost position.⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ ⟮increases by 1⟯ ⟮going further to the left⟯.
»⟮Positional notation⟯« is ⟮writing ＿a number＿⟯ ⟮using ＿a positional numeral system＿⟯.
⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ can display ⟮＿any real number＿⟯, though ⟮some will always⟯ have ⟮repeating digits⟯ (depending on the system)

##### digits

There are ⟮b-1⟯ ⟮unique digits⟯ in ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ with ⟮＿a base＿ b⟯.
The ⟮＿digits＿⟯ of ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ form ⟮a series⟯ such that ⟮they increase in value by 1⟯ starting ⟮from 0⟯.

##### operation

In ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯, once ⟮a certain digit⟯ ⟮has reached its maximum value⟯ and ⟮one more is added⟯, ⟮the digit is reset⟯ and⟮ one is added⟯ ⟮to the digit on the left⟯.

##### names of positional numeral systems

Different ⟮＿positional numeral systems＿⟯ have ⟮names⟯ depending on their ⟮＿base＿⟯.


table:positional numeral system|base
»⟮Binary⟯«|⟮2⟯
»⟮Octal⟯«|⟮8⟯
»⟮Decimal⟯«|⟮10⟯
»⟮Hexadecimal⟯«|⟮16⟯
»⟮Vigesimal⟯«|⟮20⟯

##### properties

###### endianness

»⟮Endianness⟯« is ⟮the order⟯ of ⟮＿most/least significant byte＿⟯ relative to ⟮the memory adress⟯.
⟮＿Endianness＿⟯ may be ⟮＿big＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿little-endian＿⟯.

»the ⟮least/most⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯« is the byte that ⟮has the highest base⟯
»⟮big/little⟯⟮-endian⟯« is if ＿the ⟮most/least⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯＿ is at ⟮the smallest memory address⟯.

If we write memory addresses from left to right, as is usual, then arabic numerals would be big endian.

⟮Modern processors⟯ are all ⟮＿little-endian＿⟯
⟮the internet⟯ is ⟮＿big-endian＿⟯.

###### largest numbers

⟮the largest possible number⟯ in a number of ⟮n digits⟯ of ⟮a given positional numeral system⟯ is ⟮base^n - 1⟯


table:system|largest number
⟮8-bit binary⟯|⟮255⟯

##### fractions

###### radix point

»⟮The radix point⟯« is ⟮＿a grapheme＿⟯ that separates the point in a positional numeral system where ⟮＿the index of position＿ (and thus value of the exponent)⟯ ⟮goes negative⟯.
⟮＿The radix point＿⟯ is usually written as ⟮a `.`⟯ in ⟮english⟯.
»⟮the decimal separator⟯« is ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯ when ⟮using the ＿decimal＿ ＿positional numeral system＿.⟯

###### repeating numbers

⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ has real numbers which it can only display as ⟮repeating numbers⟯.
⟮Which⟯ numbers must be displayed as repeating numbers depends on ⟮the base⟯ of the  positional numeral system.
»⟮the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem⟯« (my term) is that certain ⟮fractional numbers⟯ on computers may ⟮produce surprising results⟯.
⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯ stems from the fact that ⟮binary⟯ is used to ⟮store the numbers⟯, but ⟮c-;decimal⟯ is used to ⟮write them in source code⟯.
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, what ⟮the computer sees⟯ is ⟮0.00011 0011... + 0.0011... = ...⟯
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, the constituent numbers are ⟮repeating⟯ in ⟮binary⟯, so ⟮it is not surprsing that they could not be added⟯.

##### exponent-based notation

»⟮Exponential notation⟯« (has variant definitions that I don't care about) is a notation ⟮based on⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral notation＿⟯ that modifies the behavior of ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ used as ⟮c_;an exponent⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ or ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯.
»⟮Fixed-point notation⟯« is ⟮non⟯-⟮＿floating point notation＿⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ ⟮splits⟯ ⟮＿a numeral＿⟯ into »⟮a significand⟯« and »⟮an exponent factor⟯«, ⟮c-3;connected⟯ via ⟮multiplication⟯.
⟮＿The exponent factor＿⟯ of ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯ has the form ⟮base⎴n⎴⟯.
In ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯, the way ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ is modified is that ⟮a part of⟯ ⟮c_-;＿the index of position＿⟯ is ⟮extracted into⟯ ⟮the exponent⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯, ⟮the exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮is kept between 1 and 10⟯.
⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ may use⟮ e‹n›⟯ instead of ⟮*10^‹n›⟯ to render ⟮＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯, t⟮he exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮does not contain ＿a radix point＿⟯.

###### floating-point

⟮＿Floating-point notation＿⟯ can equivalently be said to store ⟮the position of⟯ ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯, whence ⟮its name⟯.
Since the exponent in effect ⟮stores the position of ＿the radix point＿⟯, ⟮＿the significant＿⟯ itself is implicitly ⟮an integer⟯.
TODO, skipped:
Since the base of a floating-point number is implied, it can be stored as merely two numbers, significand and exponent. (with the connection implied)

####### effects

Floating-point must be used to store what would otherwise be numbers with a radix point, but also allows for storing very large numbers (since the size can be stored as increases in exponent).
floating point operations per second  = FLOPS
FLOPS is a measure of computing performance

## angle

flex-container:✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Two_rays_and_one_vertex.png✫

An angle is the figure between two rays sharing a common endpoint.
The vertex of an angle is the common endpoint of the rays.
The measure of an angle is defined by the ratio between the length of its circular arc to its radius.
^To get the circular arc of an angle, one needs to chose an arbitrary point on one of the rays. The distance of that point to the vertex of the angle is the radius, and the circular arc is that arc that maps this point onto the other ray while preserving the radius.
The measure of an angle is often also called an angle.
A dihedral angle is the angle formed by the intersection of two planes at a line.

### kinds

An obtuse angle is an angle with a measure greater than 90° and smaller than 180°
An acute angle is an angle with a measure smaller than 90°

## measure

A measure is the indication of the size of something.

### multiplication

#### multiple

A multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer.
I.e. b is a multiple of a if there is an `n ∈ ℤ` such that `b = na`
a is a submultiple of b means b is a multiple of a.
I.e. a is a submultiple of b if there is an `n ∈ ℤ` such that `b/n = a`

#### basics

In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, numbers are stacked vertically, right aligned, separated from the result by a horizontal bar
In the default algorithm for adding/subtracting by hand, addition is done of individual digits from right to left, with carries or borrows as necessary.

#### subtraction

If while doing subtraction by hand, if the subtrahend is bigger than the minuend in any collumn, you need to borrow one from the left.

#### borrows and carries

A carry is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b + 1
A borrow is a transfer of a digit with a base b to a position with a base b - 1
a borrow is the oposite of a carry.

## integer composition and decomposition

### factorization

⟮Integer factorization⟯ is the ⟮decomposition⟯ of a composite number into ⟮a product of factors⟯.
Both the composite number and factors are integers.
The factors of the composite numbers must be smaller than the number.
a composite number is the product of two or more factors
any positive integer › 1 is either a composite number or a prime number.
factor(s) → composite number is trivial
composite number → factor(s) (integer factorization) has no known efficient algorithm
Thus, integer factorization is essential to most modern cryptography.

#### prime

Prime factorization is a subtype of integer factorization.
Prime factorization is the decomposition of an integer into a product of prime numbers.
Generating composite numbers is trivial, but there is no known efficient algorithm for integer factorization.

### prime number

A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by one and itself (is not a product of two smaller natural numbers)
A semiprime/biprime is a product of exactly two prime numbers.

## logic

https://www.codeguage.com/courses/logic/

### formal system

⟮Formal systems⟯ have roughly the following structure:
⟮A formal language⟯
⟮An inference system⟯
  ⟮A set of axioms⟯
  ⟮A set of inference rules⟯
⟮A semantics⟯

### logics

A ⟮logic⟯ is a ⟮formal system.⟯

#### propositional logic

The ⟮elements of the alphabet⟯ of ⟮a propositional logic⟯ are the ⟮propositional constants⟯, ⟮propositional variables⟯, and ⟮logical connectives⟯. 

##### terminology

⟮Propositional logic⟯ may also be called propositional calculus.
Propositional logic may also be called 0th-order logic, based on its relationship to 1st order logic.
More rarely, propositional logic is called statement logic or sentential calculus/logic.
I will shorten propositional logic to proplog.

##### propositions

A proposition is the thing that bears truth value.
A proposition may be atomic or compound.
An atomic proposition is a proposition that cannot be further analyzed into constituent propositions (in the given logic).
A compound proposition is a propositon that can be further analyzed into constituent propositions (in the given logic.)

##### proposition containers

Proposition containers express/denote propositions.
Proposition containers are either propositional constants, variables and formulas.

###### variables and constants

A propositional variable is a thing that expresses any possible atomic proposition.
A propositional constant is a thing that expresses a specific atomic proposition.

####### typographic conventions

propositional constants are written in lowercase letters starting at p.
In Germany, propositional variables are written in uppercase letters starting at A
In the anglosphere, propositional variables are written in lowercase letters starting at ϕ.

###### propositional formulas

A propositional formula expresses a compound proposition (however, perhaps only one that can be analyzed into a single atomic proposition.).
A propositional formula is a well-formed formula of elements of the alphabet of propositional logic.
A propositional formula may only have length 1, therefore all propositional constants and variables are themselves propositional formulae.
A propositional formula may also be called sentence.

###### example

!Assume an universe in which only the atomic propositions "Sam is awesome" and "Sam is cute" exist.
"Sam is awesome" and "Sam is cute" is a compound proposition.
!If we say "Sam is awesome"/"Sam is cute" is represented by the propositonal constants p/q.
`p`, `p ∨ p`, `q`, `p ∧ q`, `p ∧ q ∧ q ∧ q` is are all propositional formulae.
`p ∧ p ∨ q` would be a propositional formula expressing the compound proposition `"Sam is awesome" and "Sam is awesome" or "Sam is cute"`
A propositonal variable ϕ could either be "Sam is awesome" or "Sam is cute".

##### truth-functionality

A formula is truth-functional if its truth depends only on the truth or truth-functionality of the constituent parts.

##### derived things

###### inference rule

Rule of inference = inference rule
A inference rule is a function from sets of formulae to other formulae.

###### arguments

An argument consists of a premise set and a conclusion, and the relation if all members of the premise set are true, so must be the conclusion.
In propositional logic, the members of the premise set and the conclusion are all propositional formulae.

#### predicate logic

Predicate logic is also known as first-order logic.

### bitwise 

#### basic operations

operation|a|b|result
AND|0|0|0

OR|0|1|1
OR|1|0|1
OR|1|1|1
XOR|0|0|0
XOR|0|1|1
XOR|1|0|1
XOR|1|1|0

#### bitmasking

a bitmask is using bitwise operations to get the value of certain bits
a bitmask using bitwise AND gets a subset of bits
bitmasking with AND 1⎵2⎵ returns the parity of the number (0 = even, 1 = odd)

# analysis

## limits

A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value.
lim is an unary operator which gets the limit of an entity.
the limit of a function f(x) as x goes to a certain value c is indicated by lim⎵x→c⎵ f(x)
the value of a limit is indicated L.

### asymptotic analysis

Asymptotic analysis is a way of describing limits by approaching the input infinitely closely.
The limit is asymptotically equivalent to the value it becomes under asymptotic analysis.
a function f(x) being asymtotically equivalent to a certain limit foo is indicated f(x) ~ foo.
so, for example for f(x) = x^2 + 3x at values of x close to infinity, 3x becomes irrelevant. hence f(x) ~ n^2

#### asymptote

The asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as x andor y approach infinity.
The asymptote of a curve is also the tangent to the curve at a point in infinity.
A horizontal/vertical asymptote are created if x/y tends to infinity.

#### notation

Big O notation is used to indicate the limit an algorithm's computational complexity is asymptotically equivalent to as the input size tends to infinity.
Big O notation looks like O(n). 

## calculus

Calculus is the mathematical study of continous change.

### differential calculus

differential calculus is the branch of calculus concerned with rate of change and slopes of curves

#### differentiation

The derivate of a function is the slope/gradient of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a given point.
A differentiable function is one whose derivative exists at every point of the domain.
derivative is ableitung in german.

##### antiderivative

antiderivative = inverse derivative
An antiderivative is a differential function F whose derivative is equal to the original function f.
Antiderivatives satisfy F' = f.

### integral calculus

integral calculus is the branch of calculus concerned with the accumulation of quantities and the areas under/between curves.

# algebra

abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures.

## algebraic structure

For edification, but not currently study material:
In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 

## functions

A function is a relationship between two sets, the domain and the codomain.
A function assigns an element of the codomain to each element of the domain. 
^this however does not imply that each element of the codomain is assigned to an element of the domain, there may be unassignemd elements
An argument is a value that must be provided to the function to obtain its result.
A mathematical ⟮function⟯ takes ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮arguments⟯

### notation

functions are most often indicated by the letter f and beyond.
the value a function yields for a given element of the domain x is often denoted by f(x).
The element of the codomain that a function yields for a specific element of the domain x is often represented by y.

#### pronunciation

f(x) is read 「f of x」 in english
f(x) is read 「f von x」 in german

### sets

#### images

the image of a function is the subset of the codomain that represents all values f(x) the function can produce
The range of a function is ambiguous between the image or the codomain of a function.
the image of a subset of x is the subset of the codomain that represents all values f(x) (for the subset of x) the function can produce
Inverse image = preimage
the preimage of a given image is the subset of the domain that map onto values that are part of the image.
The preimage of the range of the whole function is the whole domain.
if the function is 𝑥⎴2⎴, then the preimage of {1,4} for this function is {−2,−1,1,2}

#### graph

The graph of the function is the set of all pairs (x, f(x)) (equivalently: (x,y)).
The graph of a function ccan be used to draw a diagram of it, often confusingly and somewhat improperly also called graph.

### types of functions

#### jective

injective, surjective, bijective function = injection, surjection, bijection
an injective function maps each x to a distinct f(x),
More formally, a function is injective if f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2.
a surjective function has at least one mapping that produces y 
More formally, a function is surjective if ∀y, ∃x such that f(x) = y.
The image of a surjective function is equivalent to it's codomain.
a bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective.
In other words, a bijective function maps exactly one element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain.

### unary operations on functions

#### inverse function

the inverse of a function f is a function that undoes the operation of f
the inverse of a function f only exists if f is bijective
the inverse of a function f is denoted by f⎴-1⎴

### properties of functions

#### monotony

monotonically increasing/decreasing may also be called non-decreasing or weakly increasing/decreasing.
strictly monotonically increasing/decreasing may also be called strictly increasing/decreasing or just increasing/decreasing.

A function is montonically increasing if ∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵) if x⎵1⎵ ≤ x⎵2⎵ also f(x⎵1⎵) ≤ f(x⎵2⎵)
A function is strictly montonically increasing if ∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵) if x⎵1⎵ ‹ x⎵2⎵ also f(x⎵1⎵) ‹ f(x⎵2⎵)
A function is montonically decreasing if ∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵) if x⎵1⎵ ≤ x⎵2⎵ also f(x⎵1⎵) ≥ f(x⎵2⎵)
A function is strictly montonically increasing if ∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵) if |x⎵1⎵ ‹ x⎵2⎵ also f(x⎵1⎵) › f(x⎵2⎵)

a function is monotonic if it is monotonically increasing or monotonically decresing
a function is strictly monotonic if it is strictly monotonically increasing or stricly monotonically decresing

#### zero

Zero = null = root
Nullstelle = zero/null/root
The zero is the point at which the graph of a function touches or intersects with the x-axis
Per definition, any zero x has the property f(x)=0

### preexisting functions

#### floor and ceil

##### floor

flex-container:✫FloorFunction_1000.gif✫


In math, the ⟮floor⟯ function of x gives the ⟮largest⟯ ⟮integer⟯ that is ⟮≤ x⟯.
The floor function is written ⟮⌊x⌋⟯.
⟮⌊x⌋⟯ is produced in latex by ⟮\lfloor x \rfloor⟯

##### ceil

flex-container:✫CeilingFunction_1000.gif✫


In math, the ⟮ceiling⟯ function of x gives the ⟮smallest⟯ ⟮integer⟯ that is ⟮≥ x⟯.
The ceil function is written ⟮⌈x⌉⟯.
⟮⌈x⌉⟯ is produced in latex by ⟮\lceil x \rceil⟯

## variable

### free and bound

A variable may be free or bound.
a ⟮free variable⟯ is one ⟮on which the value of an expression/statement⟯ ⟮depends/says something about⟯
a ⟮bound variable⟯ on the other hand is ⟮a convenience to express something⟯, that does not ⟮stand for a particular thing⟯
often an expression/statement can be ⟮rephrased⟯ to ⟮eliminate bound variables⟯ (though not always).
Variables such as the indexing variable of summation/productation notation or the input of a limit are bound variables.
There are a few common ⟮variable-binding⟯ operators, most commonly ⟮sum Σ, product Π, integral ∫, limit lim, existential quantifier ∃, universal quantifier ∀⟯

### arguments, parameters, coefficients, constants

#### arguments, parameters

A »variable« is a placeholder for something that may change.
Variables may either be arguments or parameters.
Often, variable is treated as a synonym for argument (only), but this is incorrect.
An argument is a variable that is the input of the function, that if varied produces different outcomes.
A parameter is a variable that is not provided as an input for the function. 
Instead, functions with parameters produce families of functions, where varying the parameter selects a function from the family of functions.
^By analogy: The speed of a bike depends on how fast one pedals - this is an argument. The speed of a bike also depends on the shape, weight, etc. of the bike - but varying those, you now have a different bike - this is a parameter. Leaving parameters for shape, weight, etc. of a bike undefined defines all possible relations between pedal speed and speed of the bike.
The ⟮arguments⟯ but not the parameters of a function are ⟮listed in f(...)⟯

arguments|x, y, z...
parameters|a, b, c...

#### coefficients, constants

A mathematical constant is a non-changing, well-defined mathematical object.
Examples for mathematical constants: π, e
⟮Constant⟯ is ambiguous between mathematical constant or parameter
A coefficient is a factor of a term in some expression.
A constant coefficient is a coefficient which is a factor of a term where the other factor is 1.

#### example

table:headerrows=2;f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c
element in function|is what kind of thing
a, b, c, x|variable(s)
a, b, c|parameter(s)
a, b, c|coefficient(s)
c|constant coefficent(s)
x|argument(s)

## equality

An equality is a relationship between two expressions asserting that the two expressions have the same value or represent the same amthematical object.
An identity asserts an equality of the two expressions for all values of the variables contained, at least for the domain.
Conditional = conditional equation
A conditional asserts an equality of the two expressions produce only for particular values of the variables contained.
An equation expresses the equality of two expressions by connecting them with the equals sign.
An equation is ambiguous between expressing a conditional or an identity. 

## terms and expressions

An ⟮expression⟯ in math is a combination of symbols that is well-formed and contains at least one operator.
A term is a combination of symbols that is well-formed and does not contain an operator.


table:headerrows=2;2x+3
element in function|is what kind of thing
2x+3|expression(s)
2x, 3, 2, x|term(s)

## operations

In general, an operation is the same thing as a function, but one which gets its own operator.
In an operation, the input values are known as operands.
In an operation, the symbol performing the operation is an operator.
In `3+4`, 3 and 4 are the operands.
In `3+4`, + is the operator.
We might want to consider a mathematical constant to be an operation of arity 0.

### types

#### binary

##### exponentiation

Exponentiation is a binary operation involving two operands, called the base and exponent.
Exponentiation is often written as `b⎴n⎴`, where b is the base and n is the exponent.
Exponentiation, written as `b⎴n⎴` means `Π⎵i=1⎵⎴n⎴b` .
base ≈ radix

###### logarithm

The logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation.
The logarithm of a number x is the exponent n that applied to a given base b would yield x.
If no base is given for a logarithm, it is obvious or doesn't matter.
The logarithm of x for a base b is denoted as `log⎵b⎵(x)` or `log⎵b⎵x`
`log⎵b⎵(b⎴n⎴) = n`

the natural logarithm is log⎵e⎵.
the natural logarithm log⎵e⎵ is usually just written ln.

###### axioms and derivable truths

```
b⎴1⎴ = b
b⎴0⎴ = 1
b⎵-n⎵ = 1/b^⎴-n⎴
```

### properties

#### identity element

The identity element e of a binary operation  ̇ on a set S is e ∈ S such that ∀(a ∈ S) e  ̇ a = a ∧ a  ̇ e = a.
The identity element may simply be called an identity.
The identity element of a certain operation is often called that ‹operation› identity (e.g. multiplicative identity).
The identity element of multiplication performed on real numbers is 1.
The identity element of addition performed on real numbers is 0.

#### idempotentitcity

A function/operation/etc. is ⟮idempotent⟯ if ⟮it can be applied mulitple times⟯ without ⟮changing the result⟯ ⟮beyond the initial application⟯. 
Examples for i⟮dempotent functions⟯ include ⟮abs(x), floor(x), ceil(x) etc.⟯ 

#### commutative

Commutatitivity is if changing the order of operands does not change the result.
Addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and division are noncommutative.

#### associative

Associativity is rearranging parenthesis will not change the result.
Addition and multiplication (if not mixed) are associative, subtraction and division are nonassociative.

#### distributive

something is distributive if it is both left- and right-distributive
left-distributive|ζ * (x+y) = (ζ * x) + (ζ * y)
right-distributive|(x+y) * ζ = (ζ * x) + (ζ * y)

### arguments

#### arity

The »arity« of something specifies how many ＿operands＿ or ＿arguments＿ are involved. 
Arity is a property of operations or functions.
arity and adicity are rough synonyms
The arity is specified in latinate numbers
adicity is specified in greek-derived numbers.
something variadic has an indefinite arity

table:Arity of...|Name
⟮0⟯|⟮nullary⟯
⟮1⟯|⟮unary⟯
⟮2⟯|⟮binary⟯
⟮3⟯|⟮ternary⟯
⟮n⟯|⟮n-ary⟯


#### order

Operations can be written in prefix, postfix or infix notation.

table:notation|description|alias
prefix notation|operator before operands|polish notation
postfix notation|operator after operands|reverse polish notation
infix notation|operator between operands


Trivia: The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924
