### numeral system 

»⟮A numeral system⟯« is ⟮＿a writing system＿⟯ using ⟮＿numerals＿⟯ to ⟮represent ＿numbers＿.⟯

#### numbers

»⟮A numeral⟯« is ⟮a set of ＿digits＿⟯ ⟮representing ＿a number＿⟯.
»⟮a digit⟯« is a ⟮single⟯ ⟮＿grapheme＿⟯ representing ⟮a numeric value⟯ ⟮smaller than⟯ ⟮＿the base＿⟯.

#### positional

»⟮A positional numeral system⟯« is one where ⟮the value⟯ of ⟮＿the numeral＿⟯ is ⟮the sum of⟯ ⟮the value of all ＿the digits＿⟯, and ⟮c_-3;the value⟯ of ⟮＿a digit＿⟯ is ⟮digit * ⟯⟮base⎴index of position⎴⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ is ⟮0⟯ for ⟮the rightmost position.⟯
⟮＿The index of position＿⟯ ⟮increases by 1⟯ ⟮going further to the left⟯.
»⟮Positional notation⟯« is ⟮writing ＿a number＿⟯ ⟮using ＿a positional numeral system＿⟯.
⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ can display ⟮＿any real number＿⟯, though ⟮some will always⟯ have ⟮repeating digits⟯ (depending on the system)

##### digits

There are ⟮b-1⟯ ⟮unique digits⟯ in ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ with ⟮＿a base＿ b⟯.
The ⟮＿digits＿⟯ of ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯ form ⟮a series⟯ such that ⟮they increase in value by 1⟯ starting ⟮from 0⟯.

##### operation

In ⟮＿a positional numeral system＿⟯, once ⟮a certain digit⟯ ⟮has reached its maximum value⟯ and ⟮one more is added⟯, ⟮the digit is reset⟯ and⟮ one is added⟯ ⟮to the digit on the left⟯.

##### names of positional numeral systems

Different ⟮＿positional numeral systems＿⟯ have ⟮names⟯ depending on their ⟮＿base＿⟯.


table:positional numeral system|base
»⟮Binary⟯«|⟮2⟯
»⟮Octal⟯«|⟮8⟯
»⟮Decimal⟯«|⟮10⟯
»⟮Hexadecimal⟯«|⟮16⟯
»⟮Vigesimal⟯«|⟮20⟯

##### properties

###### endianness

»⟮Endianness⟯« is ⟮the order⟯ of ⟮＿most/least significant byte＿⟯ relative to ⟮the memory adress⟯.
⟮＿Endianness＿⟯ may be ⟮＿big＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿little-endian＿⟯.

»the ⟮least/most⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯« is the byte that ⟮has the highest base⟯
»⟮big/little⟯⟮-endian⟯« is if ＿the ⟮most/least⟯ ⟮significant byte⟯＿ is at ⟮the smallest memory address⟯.

If we write memory addresses from left to right, as is usual, then arabic numerals would be big endian.

⟮Modern processors⟯ are all ⟮＿little-endian＿⟯
⟮the internet⟯ is ⟮＿big-endian＿⟯.

###### largest numbers

⟮the largest possible number⟯ in a number of ⟮n digits⟯ of ⟮a given positional numeral system⟯ is ⟮base^n - 1⟯


table:system|largest number
⟮8-bit binary⟯|⟮255⟯

##### fractions

###### radix point

»⟮The radix point⟯« is ⟮＿a grapheme＿⟯ that separates the point in a positional numeral system where ⟮＿the index of position＿ (and thus value of the exponent)⟯ ⟮goes negative⟯.
⟮＿The radix point＿⟯ is usually written as ⟮a `.`⟯ in ⟮english⟯.
»⟮the decimal separator⟯« is ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯ when ⟮using the ＿decimal＿ ＿positional numeral system＿.⟯

###### repeating numbers

⟮Any⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral system＿⟯ has real numbers which it can only display as ⟮repeating numbers⟯.
⟮Which⟯ numbers must be displayed as repeating numbers depends on ⟮the base⟯ of the  positional numeral system.
»⟮the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem⟯« (my term) is that certain ⟮fractional numbers⟯ on computers may ⟮produce surprising results⟯.
⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯ stems from the fact that ⟮binary⟯ is used to ⟮store the numbers⟯, but ⟮c-;decimal⟯ is used to ⟮write them in source code⟯.
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, what ⟮the computer sees⟯ is ⟮0.00011 0011... + 0.0011... = ...⟯
in ⟮＿the 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30...04 problem＿⟯, the constituent numbers are ⟮repeating⟯ in ⟮binary⟯, so ⟮it is not surprsing that they could not be added⟯.

##### exponent-based notation

»⟮Exponential notation⟯« (has variant definitions that I don't care about) is a notation ⟮based on⟯ ⟮＿positional numeral notation＿⟯ that modifies the behavior of ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ used as ⟮c_;an exponent⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ or ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯.
»⟮Fixed-point notation⟯« is ⟮non⟯-⟮＿floating point notation＿⟯.
⟮＿Exponential notation＿⟯ ⟮splits⟯ ⟮＿a numeral＿⟯ into »⟮a significand⟯« and »⟮an exponent factor⟯«, ⟮c-3;connected⟯ via ⟮multiplication⟯.
⟮＿The exponent factor＿⟯ of ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯ has the form ⟮base⎴n⎴⟯.
In ⟮＿exponential notation＿⟯, the way ⟮＿the index of position＿⟯ is modified is that ⟮a part of⟯ ⟮c_-;＿the index of position＿⟯ is ⟮extracted into⟯ ⟮the exponent⟯ of ⟮c_;＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯, ⟮the exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮is kept between 1 and 10⟯.
⟮＿scientific notation＿⟯ may use⟮ e‹n›⟯ instead of ⟮*10^‹n›⟯ to render ⟮＿the exponent factor＿⟯.
In ⟮＿floating-point notation＿⟯, t⟮he exponent of ＿the exponent factor＿⟯ is chosen such that ⟮＿the significand＿⟯ ⟮does not contain ＿a radix point＿⟯.

###### floating-point

⟮＿Floating-point notation＿⟯ can equivalently be said to store ⟮the position of⟯ ⟮＿the radix point＿⟯, whence ⟮its name⟯.
Since the exponent in effect ⟮stores the position of ＿the radix point＿⟯, ⟮＿the significant＿⟯ itself is implicitly ⟮an integer⟯.
TODO, skipped:
Since the base of a floating-point number is implied, it can be stored as merely two numbers, significand and exponent. (with the connection implied)

####### effects

Floating-point must be used to store what would otherwise be numbers with a radix point, but also allows for storing very large numbers (since the size can be stored as increases in exponent).
floating point operations per second  = FLOPS
FLOPS is a measure of computing performance

###### in programming

in programming, ⟮＿the positional numeral system＿⟯ used is often indicated by ⟮a prefix⟯ starting with ⟮0⟯.

## angle

flex-container:✫https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Two_rays_and_one_vertex.png✫

An angle is the figure between two rays sharing a common endpoint.
The vertex of an angle is the common endpoint of the rays.
The measure of an angle is defined by the ratio between the length of its circular arc to its radius.
^To get the circular arc of an angle, one needs to chose an arbitrary point on one of the rays. The distance of that point to the vertex of the angle is the radius, and the circular arc is that arc that maps this point onto the other ray while preserving the radius.
The measure of an angle is often also called an angle.
A dihedral angle is the angle formed by the intersection of two planes at a line.

### kinds

»⟮An obtuse angle⟯« is an angle with ⟮＿a measure＿⟯ ⟮greater than 90° and smaller than 180°⟯

##### forest

»⟮A forest⟯« is ⟮a set of unconnected trees⟯. 

#### applications

##### binary search trees

⟮A ＿binary＿ ＿search＿ ＿tree＿⟯ allows searching via ⟮the special properties⟯ that ⟮the keys⟯ are defined to have. 
In a ⟮binary search tree⟯, ⟮the key in the current vertex⟯ is ⟮larger than⟯ ⟮the key in any vertices in the left subtree⟯. 
In a ⟮binary search tree⟯, ⟮the key in the current vertex⟯ is ⟮smaller than⟯ ⟮the key in any vertices in the right subtree⟯. 

###### operations

To ⟮insert a vertex in a binary search tree⟯, we ⟮traverse the tree⟯ as if we were ⟮searching for the vertex⟯, then, ⟮sb;when ⟮we hit a leaf⟯, we ⟮insert it⟯ as ⟮left or right (as the case may be⟯).⟯ 
In ⟮deleting a vertex⟯ in ⟮a binary search tree⟯, if ⟮the vertex has no children⟯, ⟮simply delete the vertex⟯ 
In ⟮deleting a vertex⟯ in ⟮a binary search tree⟯, if ⟮the vertex has one child⟯, ⟮set the reference of the parent to that of the child⟯ 
In deleting ⟮a vertex N⟯ in ⟮a binary search tree⟯, if ⟮the vertex has two children⟯, first take ⟮the rightmost vertex of the left tree (or vice versa⟯), S. Take ⟮S's⟯ ⟮value⟯, and ⟮replace⟯ ⟮N's⟯ ⟮value⟯ ⟮with it⟯ and then ⟮delete S⟯ with ⟮the appropriate method for 0/1-child vertices⟯.

### formal system

⟮Formal systems⟯ have roughly the following structure:
```
⟮A formal language⟯
⟮An inference system⟯
  ⟮A set of axioms⟯
  ⟮A set of inference rules⟯
⟮A semantics⟯
```

### logics

A ⟮logic⟯ is ⟮a ＿formal system＿.⟯

#### propositional logic

The ⟮elements of ＿the alphabet＿⟯ of ⟮＿a propositional logic⟯＿ are the ⟮＿propositional variables＿⟯ and ⟮＿logical connectives＿⟯. 

##### terminology

⟮Propositional logic⟯ may also be called ⟮propositional calculus⟯.
⟮Propositional logic⟯ may also be called ⟮0th-order logic⟯ based on ⟮its relationship to 1st order logic⟯.
More rarely, ⟮propositional logic⟯ is called ⟮statement logic⟯ or ⟮sentential calculus/logic⟯.
I will shorten ⟮propositional logic⟯ to ⟮proplog⟯.

##### propositions

»⟮The proposition⟯« is the thing that ⟮bears truth value⟯.
⟮＿A proposition＿⟯ may be ⟮＿atomic＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿compound＿⟯.
»⟮An atomic proposition⟯« is ⟮＿a proposition＿⟯ that ⟮cannot be⟯ ⟮further analyzed into constituent propositions (in the given logic)⟯.
»⟮A compound proposition⟯« is ⟮＿a propositon＿⟯ that ⟮can be⟯ ⟮further analyzed into constituent propositions (in the given logic.)⟯

##### proposition containers

»⟮Proposition containers⟯« ⟮express/denote propositions⟯.
»⟮Proposition containers⟯« are either ⟮＿propositional variables＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿formulae＿⟯.
⟮＿A propositional variable＿⟯ expresses ⟮＿an atomic proposition＿⟯.
⟮＿A propositional formula＿⟯ expresses ⟮＿a compound proposition＿⟯.

###### propositional formulas

»⟮A propositional formula⟯« is ⟮a well-formed formula⟯ of ⟮elements of ＿the alphabet＿ of the ＿propositional logic＿⟯.
⟮＿A propositional formula＿⟯ expresses ⟮＿a compound proposition＿ (however, perhaps only one that can be analyzed into a single atomic proposition.)⟯.
⟮＿A propositional formula＿⟯ may have ⟮length 1⟯, therefore ⟮all ＿propositional variables＿⟯ are ⟮themselves propositional formulae⟯.
⟮A propositional formula⟯ may also be called ⟮sentence⟯.
⟮Propositional formula⟯ is often shortened to ⟮formula⟯.

###### metavariables

»⟮A metavariable⟯« expresses ⟮＿a propositional formula＿⟯.

###### typographic conventions

⟮＿propositional variables＿⟯ are written in ⟮lowercase letters starting at p⟯.
In Germany, ⟮＿metavariables＿⟯ are written in ⟮uppercase letters starting at A⟯
In the anglosphere, ⟮＿metavariables＿⟯ are written in ⟮lowercase letters starting at ϕ⟯.

###### example

!Assume an universe in which only the atomic propositions "Sam is awesome" and "Sam is cute" exist.
`"Sam is awesome" and "Sam is cute"` is ⟮＿a compound proposition＿⟯.
`p`, `p ∨ p`, `q`, `p ∧ q`, `p ∧ q ∧ q ∧ q` are all ⟮＿propositional formulae＿⟯.
`p ∧ p ∨ q` would be ⟮＿a propositional formula＿⟯ expressing ⟮＿the compound proposition＿⟯ `"Sam is awesome" and "Sam is awesome" or "Sam is cute"`
⟮＿A propositonal variable＿ p, q⟯ could either be "Sam is awesome" or "Sam is cute".

##### truth-functionality

A formula is »⟮truth-functional⟯« if ⟮its truth⟯ ⟮depends only⟯ on ⟮the truth⟯ or ⟮c_;＿truth-functionality＿⟯ of ⟮its constituent parts⟯.

###### inference rule

⟮Rule of inference⟯ = ⟮inference rule⟯
»⟮An inference rule⟯« is ⟮a function⟯ from ⟮sets of formulae⟯ to ⟮other formulae⟯.

###### arguments

»⟮An argument⟯« consists of a premise set and a conclusion, and the relation if all members of the premise set are true, so must be the conclusion.
In ⟮＿propositional logic＿⟯, ⟮the members of the premise set⟯ and ⟮c_;the conclusion⟯ of ⟮＿an argument＿⟯ are all ⟮＿propositional formulae＿⟯.
