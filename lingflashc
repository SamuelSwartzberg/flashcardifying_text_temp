##### phrasees

a phrase is a group of words which act together as a grammatical unit.
The head of a phrase is the thing everything else in the phrase is about.
In a phrase, everything that isn't the head is a dependent.
In head-inital/head-final languages, the head comes at the beginning/end of the phrase, respectively

###### X-bar framework-based

The X-bar theory asserts that all phrases have the structure <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png/300px-X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png">, which is called the X-bar schema.
In the X-bar theory, each node is binary, i.e. has two children.
In the X-bar theory, each phrase has a head.
in the X-bar schema, there are four types of components in each schema.
In the X-bar schema, arguments are necessary but may be empty.
In the X-bar schema, the two types of arguments are complements and specifiers
The difference between complements and specifiers is that the complement is a sister node to X, while the specifier is a sister node to X'.
In the X-bar schema, anything that is not a head or an argument is an adjunct.
Adjuncts may also be called modifiers.
Adjuncts are optional, and adjoining them creates a phrase of the same type as it originally was.
Adjunction can be recursive.

X|the head
YP|the complement

X|the minimum projection of X

In the X-bar schema, XP is theoretically X''.
In the X-bar schema, X' and X'' (XP) are projections of X.

###### types of phrases

The type of phrase a phrase is (AdvP, VP, NP...) is called phrasal category.
An XP is a phrase with X as its head.

Adjective phrases tend to describe nouns.

#### grammatical category

A grammatical category or grammatical feature is a property of items within the grammar of a language. 
Common grammatical categories/features: tense, number, gender/noun class

#### morphology

<br>---<br>
  §§ ((c:1;::Morphemes)) are the ((c:2;::smallest)) ((c:3;::unit of language)) that ((c:4;::has some sort of meaning)). §<br>
§§ ((c:5;::Morphemes)) are studied in the field of ((c:6;::morphology)). §<br>
§§ ((c:7;::Morphology)) generally deals with the ((c:8;::phonology)) and not ((c:8;::orthography)) of morphs/morphemes, as s((c:9;::peech is more basic to language than writing)). §<br>
§§ A ((c:10;::morpheme)), bearing ((c:11;::a unit of meaning)), is made up of ((c:10;::allomorphs)), which are ((c:12;::the different phonetic realizations of that morpheme)). §<br>
§§ The word ((c:13;::unbreakable)) consists of the morphemes&nbsp; ((c:14;::un, break, able.)) §<br>
§§ ((c:15;::Morphs)) and ((c:15;::morphemes)) are generally written in ((c:16;::curly braces {))}. §<br>
§§ {{c17::{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /}}} are all ((c:18;::allomorphs)) of {{c19::the morpheme {s} (plural s)}} §<br>

##### Inflection

An <dfn>inflectional paradigm</dfn> is the complete set of forms that a class of words can assume {{c1::when inflecting}}
An inflectional category is a class of inflection pattern that have a common grammatical category/feature. (i.e. its any realization of a grammatical category/feature as inflection)

A lexeme is the fundamental unit of the lexicon of a language.
A lexeme is an abstract unit that underlies all its inflectional variants.
A lexeme can be instantiated in different inflectional variants = words.
By convention, lexemes are represented in all caps.
Any lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category/word class.
A {{c1::lemma}} is the form that is chosen by {{c2::convention}} to represent the {{c3::lexeme}}.
A lexical item/unit is like a lexeme, but can be {{c1::multiple words long}}

An invariable word is a word that cannot be inflected.
Inflection can be subdivided into {{c1::Declension and conjugation}}

##### stem, base, root

A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached
The part of a word that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections is called?  the stem
The part of a word with lexical meaning that cannot be broken down any further is called what?  root
How many roots does the word 'wheelchair' have?  2

##### free and bound morphemes

What type of affixes are there?  prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix

##### compounds

In linguistics, a compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one stem.
The head of a compound is the stem that is the thing that is being modified by the other stem(s) in the compound.
name|description|formalization, assuming head-final
endocentric compound|the basic type of thing is indicated by the head, and the other stems describe that|A+B denotes a kind of b|smalltalk
exocentric compound|s a hyponym of some unexpressed semantic category (such as a person, plant, or animal)|A+B denote a special kind of unexpressed thing|white-collar, scarecrow
copulative compound|the word is what any of the stems is|A+B indicate the sum of A and B|bittersweet, sleepwalk
appositional compound|all stems are equal attributes of a certain referent|A+B indicates something that is both A and B|hunter-gatherer
A dvandva is or is a type of copulative compound

  §§ In english, ((c:1;::compounds)) can be ((c:2;::open)) = ((c:3;::containing a space)), e.g. ((c:3;::real estate)), ((c:2;::closed)) = ((c:3;::not containing a space)), e.g. ((c:3;::waistcoat, bookstore)), or ((c:2;::hyphenated)) = ((c:3;::containing a hyphen)), e.g. ((c:3;::long-term)) §<br>
§§ In english, ((c:4;::compounds)) generally ((c:5;::progress from open to closed)), sometimes ((c:6;::with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.)) §<br>

### parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar grammatical properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Part of speech may be synonymous with lexcial category if we don't acknowledge functional categories.
a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members

A|Adjective
P|Adposition
Adv|Adverb
C|coordinating conjunction
D|Determiner
I|Interjection
N|Noun
V|Verb

functional category|purely grammatical meaning|Det, Conj, Aux...
lexical category|some sort of semanting content|V, N, A, Adv...

An adposition may either be a preposition or a postposition.

## linguistic typology

Linguistic typology (or language typology) is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features. 
Linguistic typology according to a language's morphological structures and mainly how these languages create words from morphemes is known as morphological typology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.
Analytic languages contain very little inflection, and thus have very few morphemes per word (often close to one morpheme per word)
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.

highly synthetic|japanese, turkish
