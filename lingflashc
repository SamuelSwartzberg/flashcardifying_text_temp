## general

Basically, when you're not sure which linguistic units you're dealing with (be it phonemes, morphemes etc.) or it is irrelevant to your research, you use the word "segment". 
Thus, a segment is "any element, at any level of representation, which is described as forming sequences with others" (Matthews 2007).

## synchronic

### grammar

if something is empty or unpronounced, ø or <i>e</i> are often used

#### syntax

##### phrasees

a phrase is a group of words which act together as a grammatical unit.
The head of a phrase is the thing everything else in the phrase is about.
In a phrase, everything that isn't the head is a dependent.
In head-inital/head-final languages, the head comes at the beginning/end of the phrase, respectively
head-initial|English (partially)

###### X-bar framework-based

The X-bar theory asserts that all phrases have the structure <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png/300px-X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png">, which is called the X-bar schema.
In the X-bar theory, each node is binary, i.e. has two children.
In the X-bar theory, each phrase has a head.
in the X-bar schema, there are four types of components in each schema.
In the X-bar schema, arguments are necessary but may be empty.
In the X-bar schema, the two types of arguments are complements and specifiers
The difference between complements and specifiers is that the complement is a sister node to X, while the specifier is a sister node to X'.
In the X-bar schema, anything that is not a head or an argument is an adjunct.
Adjuncts may also be called modifiers.
Adjuncts are optional, and adjoining them creates a phrase of the same type as it originally was.
Adjunction can be recursive.
An adjunct can be any type of phrase.

<img src="sm_Screenshot 2020-10-13 at 00.28.29.png">
X|the head
YP|the complement
ZP|the specifier

X|the minimum projection of X
X'|neither the minimum nor the maximum projection of X
X''/XP|the maximum projection of X

In the X-bar schema, XP is theoretically X''.
In the X-bar schema, X' and X'' (XP) are projections of X.


In the X-bar framework, a phrase consists

CP

[CP [C] [IP]]
CP may either be complement or adjunct to verb/VP
to test whether a CP is an adjunct or a complement, use a proform test on the Verb/VP without the CP.

DP hypothesis: 

Often correlates with the idea that pronouns are determiners.

###### types of phrases

The type of phrase a phrase is (AdvP, VP, NP...) is called phrasal category.
An XP is a phrase with X as its head.

Adjective phrases tend to describe nouns.

#### grammatical category

A grammatical category or grammatical feature is a property of items within the grammar of a language. 
Common grammatical categories/features: tense, number, gender/noun class, person

{{c1::Grammatical person}} is the {{c2::deictical}}  distinction of {{c3::participants}} in an event. It is frequently realized in {{c4::personal pronouns}} and {{c5::verbs}} (but sometimes also in other places).

First person|The speaker
Second person|The addressee
Third person|neither speaker nor addressee

#### morphology

<br>---<br>
  §§ ((c:1;::Morphemes)) are the ((c:2;::smallest)) ((c:3;::unit of language)) that ((c:4;::has some sort of meaning)). §<br>
§§ ((c:5;::Morphemes)) are studied in the field of ((c:6;::morphology)). §<br>
§§ ((c:7;::Morphology)) generally deals with the ((c:8;::phonology)) and not ((c:8;::orthography)) of morphs/morphemes, as s((c:9;::peech is more basic to language than writing)). §<br>
§§ A ((c:10;::morpheme)), bearing ((c:11;::a unit of meaning)), is made up of ((c:10;::allomorphs)), which are ((c:12;::the different phonetic realizations of that morpheme)). §<br>
§§ The word ((c:13;::unbreakable)) consists of the morphemes&nbsp; ((c:14;::un, break, able.)) §<br>
§§ ((c:15;::Morphs)) and ((c:15;::morphemes)) are generally written in ((c:16;::curly braces {))}. §<br>
§§ {{c17::{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /}}} are all ((c:18;::allomorphs)) of {{c19::the morpheme {s} (plural s)}} §<br>
===<br>
<span class="cloze-dump">{{c1::}}{{c2::}}{{c3::}}{{c4::}}{{c5::}}{{c6::}}{{c7::}}{{c8::}}{{c9::}}{{c10::}}{{c11::}}{{c12::}}{{c13::}}{{c14::}}{{c15::}}{{c16::}}{{c17::}}{{c18::}}</span>

Alternation is a morpheme exhibiting variation in its phonological realization based on its phonological/morophological and/or syntactic environment. Variants are called alternants. TODO: is this equivalent to allomorphs?

##### Inflection

An <dfn>inflectional paradigm</dfn> is the complete set of forms that a class of words can assume {{c1::when inflecting}}
An inflectional category is a class of inflection pattern that have a common grammatical category/feature. (i.e. its any realization of a grammatical category/feature as inflection)

A lexeme is the fundamental unit of the lexicon of a language.
A lexeme is an abstract unit that underlies all its inflectional variants.
A lexeme can be instantiated in different inflectional variants = words.
By convention, lexemes are represented in all caps.
Any lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category/word class.
A {{c1::lemma}} is the form that is chosen by {{c2::convention}} to represent the {{c3::lexeme}}.
A lexical item/unit is like a lexeme, but can be {{c1::multiple words long}}

An invariable word is a word that cannot be inflected.
Inflection can be subdivided into {{c1::Declension and conjugation}}

##### stem, base, root

A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached
The part of a word that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections is called?  the stem
The part of a word with lexical meaning that cannot be broken down any further is called what?  root
How many roots does the word 'wheelchair' have?  2

##### free and bound morphemes

What type of affixes are there?  prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix

##### compounds

In linguistics, a compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one stem.
The head of a compound is the stem that is the thing that is being modified by the other stem(s) in the compound.
name|description|formalization, assuming head-final
endocentric compound|the basic type of thing is indicated by the head, and the other stems describe that|A+B denotes a kind of b|smalltalk
exocentric compound|s a hyponym of some unexpressed semantic category (such as a person, plant, or animal)|A+B denote a special kind of unexpressed thing|white-collar, scarecrow
copulative compound|the word is what any of the stems is|A+B indicate the sum of A and B|bittersweet, sleepwalk
appositional compound|all stems are equal attributes of a certain referent|A+B indicates something that is both A and B|hunter-gatherer
A dvandva is or is a type of copulative compound

###### english

<br>---<br>
  §§ In english, ((c:1;::compounds)) can be ((c:2;::open)) = ((c:3;::containing a space)), e.g. ((c:3;::real estate)), ((c:2;::closed)) = ((c:3;::not containing a space)), e.g. ((c:3;::waistcoat, bookstore)), or ((c:2;::hyphenated)) = ((c:3;::containing a hyphen)), e.g. ((c:3;::long-term)) §<br>
§§ In english, ((c:4;::compounds)) generally ((c:5;::progress from open to closed)), sometimes ((c:6;::with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.)) §<br>

### parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar grammatical properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Part of speech may be synonymous with lexcial category if we don't acknowledge functional categories.
a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members

A|Adjective
P|Adposition
Adv|Adverb
Comp|coordinating conjunction
D|Determiner
I|Interjection
N|Noun
V|Verb

functional category|purely grammatical meaning|Det, Conj, Aux...
lexical category|some sort of semanting content|V, N, A, Adv...

A word that is a member of a functional category is called a function word.
A word that is a member of a lexical category is called a content word.

An adposition may either be a preposition or a postposition.

#### det

A determiner is a word/affix that occurs that occurs together with a NP and expresses something about the reference of the noun phrase.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner
Types of determiners: Articles, Demonstratives, Quantifiers, distributive determiners, interrogative determiners

##### Quantifier

All, both, etc.

##### Articles

Examples of Articles in EN: the, an, a

##### Demonstratives

demonstrative determiners usually map onto the spatial deixis distinction
this, that, these, those, (yon, yonder)

##### posessive determiners

my, your, his, her, its, our, their

#### conj

There are two kind of conjunctions, coordinating and subordinating conjunctions.
A coordinating conjunction links two conjuncts that are the same type of phrase.

#### proforms

Proforms are function words that stand in for another phrase.
Noun|Pronouns
Verb|do (so)

##### pronouns

personal pronouns = pronouns with personal deixis (?)

#### verbs

##### transitivity

Transitivity is a property of varbs that relates to whether a verb can take objects, and how many.
transitive|takes an object
intransitive|doesn't take an object
ditransitive|takes two objects
ambitransitive|may take an object or not

##### dynstat

A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action

##### aux

Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
In English, sentences without auxiliars cannot have negation.
In English, auxiliaries cannot take an object.
Auxiliary verbs are members of the functional category, while lexical verbs are members of the lexical category.
In English, auxiliaries go before the subject NP in question inversion.
have and do may or may not be auxiliary verbs.
dummy do is do used as an auxiliary verb.
using dummy do is called do-support
do-support is used when an axuliary verb is syntactically required but none is present.

### phon

#### phonology

Phonology is a branch of linguistics that studies how lects organize their sounds.

##### segmental phonology

Segmental phonology is concerned with the analysis of speech into phonemes.

##### suprasegmental phonology

prosody is concerned with elements of speech that are larger than the segment ≈ phoneme
Suprasegmental phonology is also called prosody.
prosody is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense as a synonym to metre in poetry.

###### Elision

In linguistics, an elision or deletion is broadly defined as the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant, or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase. However, it is also used to refer more narrowly to cases where two words are run together by the omission of a final sound.
Syncope, apocope and apheresis are most commonly of unstressed vowels.

Syncope is a form of elision which is the loss of a sound from the interior of a word
Apocope is a form of elision which is the loss of a sound from the end of a word
Apheresis is a form of elision which is the loss of a sound from the beginning of a word
Haplology is a form of elision where an entire syllable is lost, where that syllable was similar to an adjacent syllable

###### Epenthesis

Epenthesis is the addition of a sound to the word.
prothesis is epenthesis at the beginning of the word.
paragoge is epenthesis at the end of the word.


###### phonotactics

Phonotactics is a branch of phonology that deals with the permissible combinations of phonemes.

#### phonetics

Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds, or in the case of sign languages, the equivalent aspects of sign.
Phonetics is traditionally divided into articulatory, acoustic and auditory phonetics.
articulatory phonetics|production of speech sounds
auditory phonetics|perception of speech sounds
acoustic phonetics|acoustic effects on speech sounds

Unit of interest: phones

##### Vowels and consonants

### Semantics

Semantics is the field of linguistics that studies the meaning of things, esp. those things per se.

#### Thematic/Semantic role

Agent, patient, theme, instrument ... 
AGENT|volitional initiator 
INSTRUMENT|Means of action
PATIENT|undergoes action, changes state
THEME|undergoes action, does not change state

#### semantic relations

A hypernym meant to be a hypernym for a specific set of terms|a cover term

### Pragmatics

#### Reference

##### Deixis

What is a word/phrase/inflection that depends on its context to be (fully) understood is called  {{c1::deictic}}
Deixis exixts mainly in three domains: personal deixis (people involved), spatial deixis (locations involved), temporal deixis (the time involved), discourse deixis (parts of the discourse).

Spatial deixis often as two or three distances, rdepending on the language.
A language with two values for spatial deixis has the values proximal and distal.
For a language with two values for spatial deixis, proximal is close(r) to the speaker and distal is far/further from the speaker.
A language with three values for spatial deixis has the values proximal, medial, and distal.
For a language with three values for spatial deixis, proximal is close(r) to the speaker, medial is close to the adressee, and distal is far from both
Languages I know that have a three-way distinction in spatial deixis are japanese and spanish primarily, and english and german only archaically.

<code>Would <mark>you</mark> like to have dinner?</code>|personal deixis
<code>She was sitting over <mark>there</mark>.</code>|spatial deixis
<code>It is raining <mark>now</mark>.</code>|temporal deixis
<code>I enjoy living in <mark>this</mark> city.</code>|spatial deixis
<code><mark>I</mark> am going to the movies.</code>|personal deixis

###### *phora

*phora is about the reference of an expression.
*phora is a form of deixis.
[ [exophora] [endophora [anaphora] [cataphora]]
Exophora|reference of expression depends on outside of the text
Endophora|reference of expression deptends on something in the text
Anaphora|form of endophora where referent depends on something before it
Cataphora|form of endophora where referent depends on something after it

In anaphora/cataphora, the thing its referent depends on is called an antecedent/postcedent respectively.
Most often, *phora is created by proforms.
In linguistics, binding is the phenomenon in which anaphoric elements such as pronouns are grammatically associated with their antecedents.
Anaphora is sometimes also used as a synonym to endophora.
"She's the nobel prize winner, y'know." - If I say that and gesture to somone, "She" is exaphora.

#### Hedge

a hedge is a word or phrase used in a sentence to express ambiguity, probability, caution, or indecisiveness about the remainder of the sentence, rather than full accuracy, certainty, confidence, or decisiveness.

### language grouping

Cover term for language, dialect, lect, family, etc|Languoid

### Psycholinguistics

#### linguistic relativity

linguistic relativity exists in a string and a weak version
linguistic relativity is more commonly but misleadingly called the sapir-whorf hypothesis.
The sapir-whorf hypothesis is misleading because sapir did not endorse it much at all, and whorf was not the first to endorse it
strong version of linguistic relativity|language determines thought completely|linguistic determinism
weak version of linguistic relativity|language influences thought to some ectent

### phraseology

### graphemics

Graphemics is the study of writing systems.
A digraph is using two graphs to write a single phoneme.
Examples of digraphs are sh for /ʃ/ in english.
Digraphs are often combined into ligatures, and as such the term also sometimes refers to those as digraphs.

## diachronic

### language geneaology

A Sprachbund is a set of geographically contiguous languages {{c1::that are more similar to each other in their structure than would be expected on the basis on their degree of genealogical relatedness}}
SAE (Standard Average European) is a sprachbund of extensive common features in europe.
euroversal is a feature that exists in (almost) all SAE languages
Germanic, Romance, Baltic, Slavic, Finno-Ugric languages as well as albanian and greek are the languages normally classifed under which group?  SAE

#### cognates

Cognates are 2 or more words that have a common etymological origin.
Cognates often but not always have a similar meaning and a similar pronunciation.
False friends are words in different languages that look/sound similar and thus give off the impression of being cognates, but are unrelated.
Cognates in the same language are called doublets.

#### language families

##### IE

{{c1::Indo-European languages}} can be most basically divided into {{c2::centum languages}} and {{c3::satem languages}}.
The {{c1::Germanic languages}} are subdivided into {{c2::east germanic languages}}, {{c3::north germanic languages}}, and {{c4::west germanic languages}}.

### language change

#### language contact

Language convergence is a type of linguistic change in which languages come to structurally resemble one another why {{c1::due to prolonged language contact}}
In a language shift, a speech community switches to a different language.

##### dialects

Dialect levelling is the process of overall reduction in the distinctive features of a dialect towards {{c1::(more similarity with) the standard language}}
Since the industrial revolution, dialect levelling has been ocurring to most languages.

##### borrowing

borrowing is the cover term for any kind of loan element.
narrative word|not a borrwoing
donor language|the language from which the word was borrowed

#### Language death

Speakers choosing to abandon a language and it thus dying|language/linguisitic suicide
Causing languages to die out|linguicide

## sociolinguistics

A spr<b>e</b>chbund is a&nbsp;group that has {{c1::a shared way of speaking}} going beyond language boundaries

note that unlike a sprachbund, this doesn't have to be geographically contiguous, and doesn't refer to whole languages, but just groups of speakers, and is generally not about vocabulary or grammar per se, but more about a more abstract manner
What might hip-hop with the characteristics of rapping, rhyme, and human beatboxing be an example of, if they occur in different langauges?  A sprechbund

### code switching

Code-switching AKA language alternation
Code-switching is when a speaker does alternates between two lects/languages in a single conversation

### speech community

A speech community is a group of people who share a common lect.
The term speech community is generally used for groups which share a very specific lect, that is with precise norms, excpectations, etc.

## multilingualism

## linguistic typology

Linguistic typology (or language typology) is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features. 

### morphological typology 

Linguistic typology according to a language's morphological structures and mainly how these languages create words from morphemes is known as morphological typology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.
Analytic languages contain very little inflection, and thus have very few morphemes per word (often close to one morpheme per word)
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.
highly analytic|chinese, vietnamese
highly synthetic|japanese, turkish

### word order

Word order is how a language orders the syntacic constituents of a language.
Word order may be a distinguishing characteristic in linguistic typology.
Even languages which typically allow large amounts of flexibility in word order generally have a typical word order, where having a different order is considered marked.

#### constituent order

the constituent order of a clause, namely the relative order of subject, object, and verb, is one way to distinguish word order.
SOV, SVO, etc

Verb-final language place the verb at the end of a clause.

V2 word order

A linguistic universal is a pattern that occurs systematically across (most often all) natural languages.
