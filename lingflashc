## general

Basically, when you're not sure which linguistic units you're dealing with (be it phonemes, morphemes etc.) or it is irrelevant to your research, you use the word "segment". 
Thus, a segment is "any element, at any level of representation, which is described as forming sequences with others" (Matthews 2007).

## synchronic

A <dfn>synchronic</dfn> viewpoint considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. 
If we're being structuralist, a synchronic approach specifically consideres the structuralist system of a language.

### grammar

Most broadly, grammar is the sets of rules governing a lect.
A reference work on the grammar of a language may also be known as a grammar.
If a string conforms to the grammar of a lect, it is called grammatical.
A grammaticality judgement is a judgement on the gramatticality of a string by a certain speaker.
grammaticality judgements are often used as linguistic evidence, generative grammar also aims to predict them.
* marks a thing that is ungrammatical.
if something is empty or unpronounced, ø or <i>e</i> are often used

#### syntax

##### frameworks

Syntax is a field where there are a bunch of frameworks or theories of how it works, but not much agreement.
Generative semantics was a response to generative grammar developed in the 1960s.
The conflict between propoonents of generative grammar and generative semantics was known as the linguistics wars.
The proponents of generative semantics in the linguistics wars called themselves {{c1::the four horsemen of the apocalypse}}
Generative semantics held that syntactic structures from meanings, rather than the other way around

##### phrasees

a phrase is a group of words which act together as a grammatical unit.
The head of a phrase is the thing everything else in the phrase is about.
In a phrase, everything that isn't the head is a dependent.
In head-inital/head-final languages, the head comes at the beginning/end of the phrase, respectively
head-initial|English (partially)

###### X-bar framework-based

The X-bar theory asserts that all phrases have the structure <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png/300px-X-bar_schema_%28basic%29.png">, which is called the X-bar schema.
In the X-bar theory, each node is binary, i.e. has two children.
In the X-bar theory, each phrase has a head.
in the X-bar schema, there are four types of components in each schema.
In the X-bar schema, arguments are necessary but may be empty.
In the X-bar schema, the two types of arguments are complements and specifiers
The difference between complements and specifiers is that the complement is a sister node to X, while the specifier is a sister node to X'.
In the X-bar schema, anything that is not a head or an argument is an adjunct.
Adjuncts may also be called modifiers.
Adjuncts are optional, and adjoining them creates a phrase of the same type as it originally was.
Adjunction can be recursive.
An adjunct can be any type of phrase.
<img src="sm_Screenshot%202020-10-13%20at%2000.10.05.png">

<img src="sm_Screenshot 2020-10-13 at 00.28.29.png">
X|the head
YP|the complement
ZP|the specifier

X|the minimum projection of X
X'|neither the minimum nor the maximum projection of X
X''/XP|the maximum projection of X

In the X-bar schema, XP is theoretically X''.
In the X-bar schema, X' and X'' (XP) are projections of X.


In the X-bar framework, a phrase consists

CP

[CP [C] [IP]]
CP may either be complement or adjunct to verb/VP
to test whether a CP is an adjunct or a complement, use a proform test on the Verb/VP without the CP.

DP hypothesis: 

Often correlates with the idea that pronouns are determiners.

###### types of phrases

The type of phrase a phrase is (AdvP, VP, NP...) is called phrasal category.
An XP is a phrase with X as its head.

Adjective phrases tend to describe nouns.

##### clauses

###### subordinate clauses

A {{c1::relative clause}} is a {{c3::subordinate clause}} which generally {{c2::describes the referent of its head}}.
In indo-european languages, a relative clause is generally introduced by a relative pronoun.

##### movement

###### wh-movement

#### grammatical category

A grammatical category or grammatical feature is a property of items within the grammar of a language. 
Common grammatical categories/features: tense, number, gender/noun class, person

##### syntactic

##### mainly related to nouns

##### mainly related to verbs

{{c1::Grammatical person}} is the {{c2::deictical}}  distinction of {{c3::participants}} in an event. It is frequently realized in {{c4::personal pronouns}} and {{c5::verbs}} (but sometimes also in other places).
Most languages distinguish three forms of grammatical person.

First person|The speaker
Second person|The addressee
Third person|neither speaker nor addressee

Evidentiality is the grammatical feature encoding what kind of evidence there is for a given statement.
A feature that encodes evidentiality is known as an evidential or verificational/validational

Mirativitiy is the grammatical feature, independent of evidentiality, encoding  the surprise/unpreparedness in relation to a given thing.

Clusivity is the grammatical feature encoding the difference between inclusive and exclusive first-person plural reference.
Inclusive first-person plural reference includes the adressee, exclusive first-person plural reference excludes the adressee.

###### tense-aspect-mmod

tense, aspect and modality are three grammatical features that are often strongly entangled in a given language and thus hard to separate.
Modality marked on a verb/VP is known as mood, however some authors also treat them as synonyms.
The marking of tense, aspect and modality is sometimes known as tense-aspect-mood
tense-aspect-mood is most often marked on verbs or via auxiliary verbs.

Aspect is a grammatical feature that tells you how time flows within the process/event itself.

Continuous|ongoing situation without interruption
Habitual|habitual, usual, customary action (imperfective but not continuous)
Progressive|continuous: ongoing and evolving 
Stative|continuous: ongoing but not evolving

Habitual be is a feature of AAVE indicating habitual aspect.
Spanish distinguishes imperfective and perfective verbs in the preterite tense.
In german, 'imperfekt' and 'perfekt' indicate tense, not aspect, despite their names!

Different forms of modality are sometimes called flavors.
Kinds of modality: epistemic, deontic


#### morphology

<br>---<br>
  §§ ((c:1;::Morphemes)) are the ((c:2;::smallest)) ((c:3;::unit of language)) that ((c:4;::has some sort of meaning)). §<br>
§§ ((c:5;::Morphemes)) are studied in the field of ((c:6;::morphology)). §<br>
§§ ((c:7;::Morphology)) generally deals with the ((c:8;::phonology)) and not ((c:8;::orthography)) of morphs/morphemes, as s((c:9;::peech is more basic to language than writing)). §<br>
§§ A ((c:10;::morpheme)), bearing ((c:11;::a unit of meaning)), is made up of ((c:10;::allomorphs)), which are ((c:12;::the different phonetic realizations of that morpheme)). §<br>
§§ The word ((c:13;::unbreakable)) consists of the morphemes&nbsp; ((c:14;::un, break, able.)) §<br>
§§ ((c:15;::Morphs)) and ((c:15;::morphemes)) are generally written in ((c:16;::curly braces {))}. §<br>
§§ {{c17::{/ s /}, {/ z /}, and {/ iz /}}} are all ((c:18;::allomorphs)) of {{c19::the morpheme {s} (plural s)}} §<br>

Alternation is a morpheme exhibiting variation in its phonological realization based on its phonological/morophological and/or syntactic environment. Variants are called alternants. TODO: is this equivalent to allomorphs?

##### Word formation

Word formation is broadly the creation of new words.
Word formation may either be the creation of variant forms of a lexeme via inflection (e.g. fly-flew), or the creation of new lexemes.
Word formation as the creation of new lexemes is known as derivation.
Derivation may be morphological or nonmorphological.
Morphological derivation is derviation by adding or removing morphemes.
Nonmorphologiccal derivation is derivation that is not directly related to the morphemes in the base.

A portmanteu is where parts of multiple words are combined into a new word/morph.
A blend/blend word word/lexical blend is a portmanteu where at least one of the parts combined is not a morph.
Sometimes, portmanteus and blends are considered synonyms, i.e. the restriction that a blend is a thing where one thing is not a morph is dropped.
In linguistics, a portmanteu or portmanteu morph may also be the merger of multiple morphs into one morph.
Examples of blend words are smog (smoke + fog) or brunch (breakfast + lunch)

For example, -t in spanish might be a portmanteu morph of the morph for 3rd person and for singular, took may be considered a portmanteu morph of take + ed.

###### morphological

In linguistics, clipping, also called truncation or shortening, is word formation by removing some segments of an existing word to create a synonym.
Clipping: Coronavirus -> rona, refridgerator -> fridge, influenza -> flu
Clipping is also different from back-formation, which proceeds by (pseudo-)morpheme rather than segment, and where the new word may differ in sense and word class from its source.

A hybrid word is a morphological derivation that derives from at least two different languages. 

###### nonmorphological

An abbreviation is a nonmorphological derivation by shortening a word.

An acronym is a type of abbreviation formed from the first letters of other words.
Examples of acronyms include ATM for automated teller machine and SIA for singapore international airlines

A numeronym at its most common is a word based on/using numbers.
Most commonly, a numeronym (a number based on/using numbers) is an abbreviation.
Numeronyms as abbreviations frequently either count the amount of letters in a word, have the numbers stand for words thus forming a weird acronym, or use the number metonymically.
Examples for numeronums: 9/11 (date metonym), i18n (letter count), 4649 (weird syllablecronym)

###### Productivity

productivity is the degree to which native speakers of a language use a particular grammatical process, especially in word formation.
The polar ends of productivity are productive and unproductive.
Word formation processses that are applied very infrequently are likely unproductive.
In english, using ablauts to create preterite verbs is unproductive, while using -ed to create preterite verbs is productive.

##### Inflection

An <dfn>inflectional paradigm</dfn> is the complete set of forms that a class of words can assume {{c1::when inflecting}}
An inflectional category is a class of inflection pattern that have a common grammatical category/feature. (i.e. its any realization of a grammatical category/feature as inflection)
A lexeme that lacks some of the forms of its inflectional paradigm is defective.
beware is a verb that is defective, as we can see by the fact that we can't say she bewares (of) the dog.

##### Lexeme

A lexeme is the fundamental unit of the lexicon of a language.
A lexeme is an abstract unit that underlies all its inflectional variants.
A lexeme can be instantiated in different inflectional variants = words.
By convention, lexemes are represented in all caps.
Any lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category/word class.
A {{c1::lemma}} is the form that is chosen by {{c2::convention}} to represent the {{c3::lexeme}}.
A lexical item/unit is like a lexeme, but can be {{c1::multiple words long}}
Lexical item and lexical unit are synonyms.

The lexis of a language is, depending on your definition, either a subset (of words) grouped by a specific linguistic criteria or {{c1::the complete set of all possible words in a language}}
Lexicon seems to be a synonym of lexis.

An invariable word is a word that cannot be inflected.
Inflection can be subdivided into {{c1::Declension and conjugation}}

##### stem, base, root

A base is any morphological unit to which affixes can be attached
The part of a word that is commonly used as a starting point for inflections is called?  the stem
The part of a word with lexical meaning that cannot be broken down any further is called what?  root
How many roots does the word 'wheelchair' have?  2

##### free and bound morphemes

###### affixes

What type of affixes are there?  prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix
Affixes are bound morphemes attached to the stem for word formation.
prefix|before the word|a- (e.g. atheist)
suffix|after the word|-s (plural suffix)
circumfix (more rarely confix or ambifix)|a affix that has a part that goes before and a part that goes after the word|o- ... -ni naru
duplfix|synonym of reduplication
infix|affix inserted into a word stem

Reduplication is the process in which a morpheme is repeated within a single word
Japanese frequently does reduplication, mainly for the plural.
In japanese, reduplication of a kanji is marked with 々.

A {{c1::libfix}} is a {{c2::productive}} {{c3::bound morpheme affix}} created by {{c4::back-formation}}, which still {{c5::contains some of the original meaning of the word}}.
{{c1::-gate, -cation, -tard, -verse}} are examples of {{c2::libfixes}}

##### compounds

In linguistics, a compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one stem.
The head of a compound is the stem that is the thing that is being modified by the other stem(s) in the compound.
name|description|formalization, assuming head-final
endocentric compound|the basic type of thing is indicated by the head, and the other stems describe that|A+B denotes a kind of b|smalltalk
exocentric compound|s a hyponym of some unexpressed semantic category (such as a person, plant, or animal)|A+B denote a special kind of unexpressed thing|white-collar, scarecrow
copulative compound|the word is what any of the stems is|A+B indicate the sum of A and B|bittersweet, sleepwalk
appositional compound|all stems are equal attributes of a certain referent|A+B indicates something that is both A and B|hunter-gatherer
A dvandva is another name for an appositional compound.
If the english word for siblings was a dvandva/appositional compound and we believed in the gender binary, it would be brothersister.
Japanese forms appositional compounds, which will generally not display 連濁.
e.g. <ruby>山<rp>(</rp><rt>やま・さん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>川<rp>(</rp><rt>かわ・せん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> for mountains and rivers = scenery and <ruby>左<rp>(</rp><rt>さ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>右<rp>(</rp><rt>ゆう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> for left and right = control.
Japanese endocentric compounds will generally display 連濁 if phonotactically possible.

###### english

<br>---<br>
  §§ In english, ((c:1;::compounds)) can be ((c:2;::open)) = ((c:3;::containing a space)), e.g. ((c:3;::real estate)), ((c:2;::closed)) = ((c:3;::not containing a space)), e.g. ((c:3;::waistcoat, bookstore)), or ((c:2;::hyphenated)) = ((c:3;::containing a hyphen)), e.g. ((c:3;::long-term)) §<br>
§§ In english, ((c:4;::compounds)) generally ((c:5;::progress from open to closed)), sometimes ((c:6;::with a hyphenated form as an interim phase.)) §<br>

### parts of speech

A part of speech/word class is a category of words with similar grammatical properties.
Part of speech is synonymous with word class.
Part of speech may be synonymous with lexcial category if we don't acknowledge functional categories.
a closed word class is one that rarely or never accepts new members
an open word class is one that can be extended without limit/readily accepts new members
Clear distingction of word classes are difficult across languages.

A|Adjective
P|Adposition
Adv|Adverb
Comp|coordinating conjunction
D|Determiner
I|Interjection
N|Noun
V|Verb

esp. in generative grammar, functional and lexical categories are often distinguished.
functional category|purely grammatical meaning|Det, Conj, Aux...
lexical category|some sort of semanting content|V, N, A, Adv...

A word that is a member of a functional category is called a function word.
A word that is a member of a lexical category is called a content word.

An adposition may either be a preposition or a postposition.

#### det

A determiner is a word/affix that occurs that occurs together with a NP and expresses something about the reference of the noun phrase.
Often, for any given pronoun, there is a similar or identical determiner
Types of determiners: Articles, Demonstratives, Quantifiers, distributive determiners, interrogative determiners

##### Quantifier

All, both, etc.

##### Articles

Examples of Articles in EN: the, an, a

##### Demonstratives

demonstrative determiners usually map onto the spatial deixis distinction
this, that, these, those, (yon, yonder)

##### posessive determiners

my, your, his, her, its, our, their

#### conj

There are two kind of conjunctions, coordinating and subordinating conjunctions.
A coordinating conjunction links two conjuncts that are the same type of phrase.

#### proforms

Proforms are function words that stand in for another phrase.
Noun|Pronouns
Verb|do (so)

##### pronouns

personal pronouns = pronouns with personal deixis (?)

#### verbs

##### transitivity

Transitivity is a property of varbs that relates to whether a verb can take objects, and how many.
transitive|takes an object
intransitive|doesn't take an object
ditransitive|takes two objects
ambitransitive|may take an object or not

##### dynstat

Dynamic and static verbs are often contrasted.
A dynamic verb is a verb that describes an action.
A stative (unclear relation to stative aspect) verb is a verb that descirbes a state.
setzen is a dynamic verb while sitzen is a dynamic verb.

##### aux

Non auxiliary verbs are called lexical verbs.
auxiliary verb is frequenly abbreviated auxiliary.
In English, sentences without auxiliars cannot have negation.
In English, auxiliaries cannot take an object.
Auxiliary verbs are members of the functional category, while lexical verbs are members of the lexical category.
In English, auxiliaries go before the subject NP in question inversion.
have and do may or may not be auxiliary verbs.
dummy do is do used as an auxiliary verb.
using dummy do is called do-support
do-support is used when an axuliary verb is syntactically required but none is present.

#### changing parts of speech

##### nominalization

Nominalization is the process of treating / transforming something which is not a noun as / into a noun / head of an NP.
A nominalizer is a thing, usually a bound morpheme, that nominalizes a thing.
Japanese has three basic nominalizers: こと、もの、の

### phon

#### phonology

Phonology is a branch of linguistics that studies how lects organize their sounds.

##### morphophonolgy

###### sandhi

Sandhi is a cover term for sound changes that happen at morpheme/word boundaries
Sandhi is a part of morphophonology.
Japanese exhibits two forms of sandhi, 連濁 and 連声.
連声 is the phenomenon that when a morpheme ending in ん and a morpheme beginning with a vowel collide, the second morpheme will instead begin /n<vowel>/
てんおう → てんのう is an example of 連声

##### segmental phonology

Segmental phonology is concerned with the analysis of speech into phonemes.

###### phonemic contrast

Phonemic contrast is the minimal phonetic difference to mark two phones as belonging to different phonemes.
A difference marking phonemic contrast is said to be contrastive or phonemic.
a minimal pair is two or more words that differ only in one distinctive feature.
In english phonology, rip and lip form a minimal pair.
minimal pairs may also be used in syntax, where they differ in one word/branching structure.
If two or more words form a minimal pair, the phones are proven to have phonemic contrast and thus be phonemes.


###### the syllable

structure of the syllable

<table>

<span class="cloze-dump">{{c1::}}{{c2::}}{{c3::}}{{c4::}}{{c5::}}</span>

The syllable is typically represented by σ.
Syllables must at least have a nucleus.
The nuleus of a sullable is almost always a vowel, except in the case of syllabic consonants.
When writing syllables, vowels are typically indicated V and consonants C.
A vowel that forms a syllable boundary and thus not the nucleus is known as a semivowel.
A consonant that forms the nucleus of a syllable is known as a syllabic consonant.
Only consonants are explicitly marked as syllabic with the IPA symbol when necessary, as it is presumed that vowels are also syllable nuclei.
An open syllable is a syllable without a coda. (CV, V, ...) 
A closed syllable is a syllable with a coda. (CVC, VC, ...) 
In japanese most syllables are open syllables, either CV or V.

monosyllable|Word that consists of a single syllable
dibisyllable|Word that consists of two syllables
trisyllable|Word that consists of three syllables
polysyllable|Word that consists of either more than one or more than three syllables

Syllable breaks are explicitly marked in teh IPA by <code>.</code> or when that would be too confusing by $
The stress and secondary stress marks also imply a syllable break.
Using spaces in the IPA implies a syllable break, if you want to prevent this, use the ‿ symbol.

##### suprasegmental phonology

prosody is concerned with elements of speech that are larger than the segment ≈ phoneme
Suprasegmental phonology is also called prosody.
prosody is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense as a synonym to metre in poetry.
{{c1::Prosody/Suprasegmental phonology}} contains phenomena such as Intonation, Tempo, Stress, Rythm amongst others
Many phenomena of prosody have to do with syllables.
The basic rythmic unit of indo-european poetry is a foot.

###### Elision

In linguistics, an elision or deletion is broadly defined as the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant, or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase. However, it is also used to refer more narrowly to cases where two words are run together by the omission of a final sound.
Syncope, apocope and apheresis are most commonly of unstressed vowels.

Syncope is a form of elision which is the loss of a sound from the interior of a word
Apocope is a form of elision which is the loss of a sound from the end of a word
Apheresis is a form of elision which is the loss of a sound from the beginning of a word
Haplology is a form of elision where an entire syllable is lost, where that syllable was similar to an adjacent syllable

###### Epenthesis

Epenthesis is the addition of a sound to the word.
prothesis is epenthesis at the beginning of the word.
paragoge is epenthesis at the end of the word.


###### phonotactics

Phonotactics is a branch of phonology that deals with the permissible combinations of phonemes.

###### stress

In linguistics, and particularly phonology, stress or accent is the relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence.
The IPA distinguishes between primary and secondary stress, the symbol follows polish notation in both casees.
primary stress|ˈ (ˈa; sɐˈbiɐ)
secondary stress|ˌ (ˌa; [ˈfotəˌɡɹæf])

#### phonetics

Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds, or in the case of sign languages, the equivalent aspects of sign.
Phonetics is traditionally divided into articulatory, acoustic and auditory phonetics.
articulatory phonetics|production of speech sounds
auditory phonetics|perception of speech sounds
acoustic phonetics|acoustic effects on speech sounds

Unit of interest: phones


##### distinctive feature

distinctive features are features that describe binary phonetic values.
Distinctive features are *relevant* for phonemic contrast in phonetics.
In phonology, a natural class is a set of phonemes in a language that share certain distinctive features.
When a phone has multiple feature specifications that we are interested in talking about, we produce a feature matrix. [g] could be [+voiced, +dorsal, +high]. 
Distinctive features are typically grouped into major class features, manner features, place features, and laryngeal features.
Major class features are a group of four features that share little in common phonetically, but describe the overall type of a phone.
The four major class features are [+/- syllabic], [+/- approximant], [+/- consonantal or eqivalently +/- vocalic], [+/- sonorant]

###### IPA



##### anatomy

The laryx containes the vocal cords/folds, the gap between which is called the glottis.
The vocal tract is all the anatomy above the laryx used for speech production.
The vocal tract consists of the buccal, oral, nasal and pharyngeal cavities, and the articulators contained within.
The pharynx is the posterior part of the vocal tract, consisting of a tube of muscles sitting above the larynx.
The pharynx describes the pharyngeal cavity.
The buccal cavity is the space between the teeth and the cheeks.
The oral cavity aka the mouth is the space between the pharynx and the lips.

##### consonants

The difference between consonants and vowels is that for vowels, the vocal tract is less narrowed than for consonants.
Whether something is a consonant is described by the major class feature [+/- consonantal]
There exist voiceless nasals, but no extra IPA symbols for them (they must be diacriticized)
Whether voiceless approximants exist is controversial
Consonants are traditionally categorized by their manner and place of articulation as well as their voicing.

###### signeltons and geminates

Singleton and geminate are two types of consonates distinguished by consonant length.
A geminate consonant is articulated for longer than a singleton.
A geminate consonant is also just called geminate.
The process of a singleton becoming a geminate is called gemination.
In many alphabets, geminates are written with doubled letters.
gemination is phonemic/contrastive in japanese but not in english, german or spanish.
For gemination, lengthened fricatives, nasals, laterals, approximants and trills are simply prolonged. In lengthened stops, the obstruction of the airway is prolonged, which delays release, and the "hold" is lengthened. 
In japanese, gemination is marked by っ.
In japanese, non-phonemic gemination implies emphasis.

###### Coarticulation

Co-articulated consonants are consonants produced with two simultaneous places of articulation.

co-articulated consonants
doubly articulated consonants|consonants with secondary articulation

secondary articulation is the articulation that happens when a consonant has two or more places of articulation, at least one of which has the manner of approximant.
Secondary articulation is indicated in the IPA by superscripting the approximant version of the letter.
It's important to realize that although the superscripting of a letter for secondary articulation seems to imply that it is simlar to the release diacritics which also use superscripts, in fact secondary articulation is simultaneous to the primary articulation.

###### IPA mnemonics

Progression of voiceless stops (palatal, velar, uvular)?  ckq]

##### mechanics

Speech production is the process by which thoughts are translated into speech.
Speech production is not the same as language production since language can also be produced manually by signs. 
The phonetic part of speech production is divided into three parts, which are sequentially initiation, phonation and articulation.

###### initiation

Initation is the production of the airstream that will constitute the produced sound.
The organ generating the airstream in initation is called the initiatior.
There are three initiators commonly used in human language, the diaphragm+ribs+lungs. the glottis, and the tongue.
Besides the three initators used in human speech, the cheeks may also be used, though no natural language does this, and the esophagus may be used in case of a laryngectomy.
diaphragm+ribs+lungs|pulmonic mechanism
glottis|glottalic mechanism
tongue|lingual/velaric mechanism
cheeks|buccal mechanism
esophagus|esophageal mechanism

There is also a category of consonants produced without any airstream mechanism, these are known as percussive consonants.

Any initiator may in theory act by increasing or decreasing pressure to generate an airstream.
In general, if an initiator increases the air pressure, the airflow will be outward, if an initiator decreases the air pressure, the airflow will be inward. 
An initiator increasing the pressure is termed egressive, an initiator decreasing the pressure is termed ingressive.

The combination of the three common initiators plus egressive/ingressive produces six possible combinations. However, lingual/velaric egressive and pulmonic ingressive are not commonly used.

###### phonation

The laryngeal features are features that describe how the larynx is involved in speech production.
The three laryngeal distinctive features are [+/- voiced], [+/- aspirated AKA spread glottis], [+/- glottalized AKA constricted glottis]

Phonation is any state of the larynx that modifies the airstream.
Phonation may sometimes more narrowly refer to voicing.
Voicing is the part of phonation where the vocal cords/folds vibrate (or not).
Something voiced has the distinctive feature [+voice]
Something unvoiced or voiceless has the distinctive feature [-voice]

Aspiration is a laryngeal phenomenon where the vocal folds remain open aka spread after a sound is produced.
For voicelessness, the glottis need to remain open, therefore the feature [+/- spread glottis] is sometimes used for aspirated consonants (and h) as well as voiceless things. Sometimes the distinctive feature of [+/- aspiration] is used instead, and narrowly for aspiration.
Aspiration is indicated in the ipa via <span class='ipa'>◌ʰ</span>
Aspiration seems like a little burst of air to the speaker.
The burst of air for aspiration can be felt by putting ones hand in front of one's mouth while saying an aspirated thing.

Glottalization is the partial or complete closure or constriction of the glottis.
Glottalization as partial constriction results in creaky voice
Glottalization as total constriction produces the glottal stop, or a glottalic consonant if together with a different closure, in this case, it is acting as an initiator.
Glottalization as a laryngeal distinctive feature may be specified as [+/- glottalization or +/- constricted glottis]
glottal consonants have the glottis as their articulatior, in a sense.
There are two manners assoicated with glottal consonants, 'oral' stops and fricatives.
the glottal stop has [+glottalization] [-voice]
the voiceless glottal fricative has [-glottalization] [-voice]
And then there's the breathy-voiced glottal fricative

###### articulation

Articulation is the shaping of airflow to get a sound.
An articulator is a feature within the vocal tract that is used for articulation.
An active articulator moves to create a speech sound, a passive articulator stays put.
Most often it is the combination of an active and a passive articulatior that performs articulation.

####### Place of articulation

The place of articulation is where the obstruction between the articulators occurs.
While the glottis is often seen as a place of articulation, it is involved in phonation at the same time. 
The place of articulation is described by the place distinctive features.

######## Passive place of articulation

The upper lip (labial)
The upper teeth, either on the edge of the teeth or inner surface (dental)
The alveolar ridge, the gum line just behind the teeth (alveolar)
The back of the alveolar ridge (post-alveolar)
The hard palate on the roof of the mouth (palatal)
The soft palate further back on the roof of the mouth (velar)
The uvula hanging down at the entrance to the throat (uvular)
all uvular voiced sounds have small-caps IPA symbols
The throat itself, a.k.a. the pharynx (pharyngeal)
The epiglottis at the entrance to the windpipe, above the voice box (epiglottal)
While pharyngeal and epiglottal sounds are sometimes distinguished, there seems to be no clear basis for distinction.
Sounds that have a h/H as an IPA symbol are either pharyngeal/epiglottal or glottal.

######## Active place of articulation

The lower lip (labial)
Various parts of the front of the tongue (coronal):
    The tip of the tongue (apical)
    The upper front surface of the tongue just behind the tip, called the blade of the tongue (laminal)
    The surface of the tongue under the tip (subapical)
The body of the tongue (dorsal)
The base a.k.a. root of the tongue and the throat (pharyngeal)
The aryepiglottic fold inside the throat (aryepiglottal)

####### Manner of articulation

The manner of articulation is the configuration of articulators when producing a speech sound.
The manner of articulation is described by the manner distinctive features [+/- continuant], [+/- nasal], [+/- strident], [+/- lateral], [+/- delayed release], plus the major class distinctive features.

######## stops

While stop or occlusive may often refer to merely the oral variety, nore properly they refer to any consonant where the airflow is blocked in the vocal tract, but not necessarily in the nasal tract.
Oral occlusives/stops are occlusives/stops, but so are nasal stops, implosives, ejectives, click consonants and affricates to a certain extent.
In phonetics, liquids are a class of consonants consisting of voiced lateral approximants like /l/ together with rhotics like /r/
stops build up pressure, which needs to be released.
The opposite of a stop or occulusive is a continuant.
Whether something is a stop or continuant is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/- continuant]

######## lateral consonants

A lateral is a consonant in which the airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. 
Whether something is lateral is described by the feature [+/- lateral]

######## Nasals 

A nasal sound is one where velum is lowered to allow air to escape through the nose.
Whether a sound is nasal is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/-] nasal
To indicate a nasal sound for which there is no dedicated ipa letter, <span class='ipa'>◌̃</span> is used.
A nasal stop is a nasal sound where there is an oral occlusion as well.
Other nasal sounds are nasalized vowels as well as other non-stop nasal consonants.
A nasal is generally though misleadingly used as a term for a nasal stop/nasal occlusive.



While manner of articulation is typically only applied to consonants, the distinction between sonorants or obstruents also applies to vowels, which are sonorants.
Speech sounds are either sonorants or obstruents.
Whether something is a sonorant is indicated by the distinctive feature [+son(orant)]

######## Sonorants

A sonorant is a speech sound that is produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow.
Sonorants that are not voiced are existant but rare.
Sonorants may be said to be made up of approximants in the wide sense and nasals.
Sonorants may be said to be made up of approximants in the narrow sense, vowels, and nasals.

######## Approximants

An approximant is a distinctive feature that encompasses all sonorants except nasals.
In a more narrow definition, approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision to create turbulent airflow. 
Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence.
Although "semivowel" and "approximant" are sometimes treated as synonymous, most authors use the term "semivowel" for a more restricted set; there is no universally agreed-upon definition, and the exact details may vary from author to author.
Not only are semivowels not syllabic, they are are also closer/a type of approximant.


####### vowels

Monopthong and dipthong are two kinds of vowels often distinguished.
A monopthong is a vowel sound that stays the same during its articulation = includes one vowel.
A dipthong is a vowel sound that changes between two vowels during articulation = includes two vowels.
A monopthong may be called a pure, a dipthong an impure vowels.
Since a dipthong changes from one vowel to another, it may also be called a glide.

For the IPA vowel chart, further down more open and further up more closed since it describes tngue height relative to the top of the mouth

####### obstruents

An obstruent is a speech sound that is produced by obstructing airflow.
For obstruents, the vocal tract is either completely closed or closed enough to create turbulence.
All obstruents are consonants, but consonants may also be sonorants
Obstruents are either plosives,  fricatives or affricates.

######## oral occlusives

A plosive/oral occlusive/oral stop is an obstruent consonant in which an occlusion in the vocal tract is formed that stops all airflow.
Plosives are also called oral occlusives or oral stops.
While oral stop, plosive and oral occlusive are synonyms, the terms have different geneses: "Stop" refers to the airflow that is stopped. "Occlusive" refers to the articulation, which occludes (blocks) the vocal tract. "Plosive" refers to the release burst (plosion) of the consonant.
The term plosive may be seen as inappropriate for plosives without an audible release, these are soemtimes called appolosives.

Oral stops can be released in different ways:
no audible release|<span class='ipa'>◌̚</span>, e.g. <span class='ipa'>p̚</span>
nasal release|superscript of the relevant nasal stop, e.g. <span class='ipa'>◌ⁿ</span>
lateral release|<span class='ipa'>◌ˡ</span>
Oral stops/oral occlusives/plosives with no audible release release their occlusion with no audible burst.
Oral stops with nasal release release the stop into some sort of nasal stop
Oral stops with nasal release release the stop into some sort of lateral consonant



######## fricatives

A fricative are obstruent consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together.
The turulent airflow produced for the formation of fricatives is called frication.
Stridents are a subset of fricatives where additionally a stream of air is directed by the tongue towards the teeth, resulting in higher amplitude and pitch, sibilants are a further subset of these.
Stridency is encoded in the distinctive feature [+/- strident]

######## affricates

An affricate is an obstruent consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative, generally with the same place of articulation.
Affricates in the IPA are indicated by two symbols united by a tie on top or more rarely at the bottom.
p͡f, t͡ɕ etc.
Affricates are distinguised from non-affricates in that they have the disinctive feature [+delayed release]

##### IPA

If there is no 'room' beneath an IPA symbol, you place a diacritic that would normally go there above instead.
For vowels, <span class='ipa'>◌ˑ</span> indicates a half-length vowel, while <span class='ipa'>◌̆</span> indicates an extra-short vowel.
For vowels and consonants both, <span class='ipa'>◌ː</span> indicates something that is longer, for consonants specifically it indicates gemination

### Semantics

Semantics is the field of linguistics that studies the meaning of things, esp. those things per se.

#### figures of speech

A metonym is when something is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing.
Synechdoche is a form of metonymy where a part refers to a whole of something or a whole to one of its parts.
Pars pro toto is synechdoche where a part refers to a whole.
Individual body parts are often used to refer to an entire body, constituting a pars pro toto: "skin" or "hide" ("save your skin" or "skin in the game" or "the teacher will have my hide"), "mouth" ("mouth to feed"), "head" ("head count")
Totum pro parte is synechdoche where a whole refers to its part.
An example for a totum pro parte is the word America for the United States.

#### reference

In semantics, a modifier is said to be restrictive if it restricts the reference of its head.
Relative clauses generally are restrictive.

#### Thematic/Semantic role

Semantic role aka thematic role aka theta role.

Agent, patient, theme, instrument ... 
AGENT|volitional initiator 
INSTRUMENT|Means of action
PATIENT|undergoes action, changes state
THEME|undergoes action, does not change state

#### semantic relations

A hyponym is a more specific term than its hypernym.
A hypernym ⊃ a hyponym 
<div class="onion-box"><span>((c:2;::hypernym))</span><div class="onion-box"><span>((c:;::hyponym))</span></div></div>
“Musical instrument” is a {{c1::hyper(o)nym}} of “guitar” because a guitar is a musical instrument.
A hyponym that is the same word as its hypernym is {{c1::An autohyponym}}
A hypernym meant to be a hypernym for a specific set of terms|a cover term
A hypernym may also be called an umbrella term or a blanket term.

### Pragmatics

Pragmatics is the subfield that studies how context contributes to meaning.

In linguistics, a phatic expression is communication which serves a social function, not a semantic one.

#### Speech acts

Speech act theory is the field studying speech acts.
A speech act includes everything that happens when a speaker utters a utterance.
The idea of speech acts was popularized by JL Austin in How to Do Things with Words (1962).

##### Austins orig distinction

The original distincition Austin made before he arrived at speech acts was between {{c1::constative and performative utterances}} utterances.
constative utterances (=constatives)|have a truth value, state a fact
performative utterances (=performatives)|do something else besides state a fact
In austins original distinction, the hereby criterion was used to determine if something was a performative.
An utterance is performative according to the hereby-criterion, if inserting the word hereby into the sentence {{c1::Basically preserves the meaning}}
<q>I promise to pay you 50$ tomorrow.</q> is performative? {{c1::<q>I hereby promise to pay you 50$ tomorrow.</q> -&gt; works -&gt; performative}}
<q>The cat is on the mat.</q> is not performative?  <q>The cat is hereby on the mat.</q> -&gt; has changed the meaning -&gt; not performative (constative)
Problematically for austins original distinction, a sentence can both performative and constative.

##### Austins later distinction

Later, austin moved to a distinction between locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary speech acts.
According to austin, each utterance has a locutionary and illocutionary act attached to them, even if the illlocutionary act may only be that of asserting.
locutionary act|comprised of the performance of an utterance in all its phonological, syntactic and semantic aspects
the illocutionary act is what one does **in** saying something.
Examples of illocutionary acts: announcing; assuring; authorizing; censuring; committing; complimenting; conceding; confessing;...
the perlocutionary act is what has done due to the consequences of saying something.
the perlocutionary act depends of the reaction of the hearers, the illocutionary act does not.
Examples of perlocutionary ac
a locutionary, illocutionary or perlocutionary act has a locutionary, illocutionary or perlocutionary force attached.
Frightening is a perlocutionary not an illocutionary act because it depends on the hearer to be frightened.
Illocutionary and perlocutionary acts try to achieve some perlocutinary effect.

#### Reference

##### Deixis

What is a word/phrase/inflection that depends on its context to be (fully) understood is called  {{c1::deictic}}
Deixis exixts mainly in three domains: personal deixis (people involved), spatial deixis (locations involved), temporal deixis (the time involved), discourse deixis (parts of the discourse).

Spatial deixis often as two or three distances, rdepending on the language.
A language with two values for spatial deixis has the values proximal and distal.
For a language with two values for spatial deixis, proximal is close(r) to the speaker and distal is far/further from the speaker.
A language with three values for spatial deixis has the values proximal, medial, and distal.
For a language with three values for spatial deixis, proximal is close(r) to the speaker, medial is close to the adressee, and distal is far from both
Languages I know that have a three-way distinction in spatial deixis are japanese and spanish primarily, and english and german only archaically.

<code>Would <mark>you</mark> like to have dinner?</code>|personal deixis
<code>She was sitting over <mark>there</mark>.</code>|spatial deixis
<code>It is raining <mark>now</mark>.</code>|temporal deixis
<code>I enjoy living in <mark>this</mark> city.</code>|spatial deixis
<code><mark>I</mark> am going to the movies.</code>|personal deixis

###### *phora

*phora is about the reference of an expression.
*phora is a form of deixis.
[ [exophora] [endophora [anaphora] [cataphora]]
Exophora|reference of expression depends on outside of the text
Endophora|reference of expression deptends on something in the text
Anaphora|form of endophora where referent depends on something before it
Cataphora|form of endophora where referent depends on something after it

In anaphora/cataphora, the thing its referent depends on is called an antecedent/postcedent respectively.
Most often, *phora is created by proforms.
In linguistics, binding is the phenomenon in which anaphoric elements such as pronouns are grammatically associated with their antecedents.
Anaphora is sometimes also used as a synonym to endophora.
"She's the nobel prize winner, y'know." - If I say that and gesture to somone, "She" is exaphora.

#### Hedge

a hedge is a word or phrase used in a sentence to express ambiguity, probability, caution, or indecisiveness about the remainder of the sentence, rather than full accuracy, certainty, confidence, or decisiveness.

### language grouping

Cover term for language, dialect, lect, family, etc|Languoid

### Psycholinguistics

#### linguistic relativity

linguistic relativity exists in a string and a weak version
linguistic relativity is more commonly but misleadingly called the sapir-whorf hypothesis.
The sapir-whorf hypothesis is misleading because sapir did not endorse it much at all, and whorf was not the first to endorse it
strong version of linguistic relativity|language determines thought completely|linguistic determinism
weak version of linguistic relativity|language influences thought to some ectent

### phraseology

Phraseology is the study of phrasemes and related phenomena.

A {{c1::snowclone}} is a {{c2::cliche}} {{c3::phrase}} with {{c4::one or more blanks}} that {{c5::keeps getting}} reused.
{{c1::&nbsp;In space, no one can hear you X; X is the new Y; The mother of all X; X-ing while Y; To X or not to X; Have X, will travel; X considered harmful}} are examples of {{c2::snowclones}}

### graphemics

Graphemics is the study of writing systems.
A digraph is using two graphs to write a single phoneme.
Examples of digraphs are sh for /ʃ/ in english.
Digraphs are often combined into ligatures, and as such the term also sometimes refers to those as digraphs.

## diachronic

A <dfn>diachronic</dfn> approach considers the history and evolution of a language.
Historical linguistics is mainly interested in language change.

### language geneaology

* marks a form that is reconstructed (i.e. not attested)
A Sprachbund is a set of geographically contiguous languages {{c1::that are more similar to each other in their structure than would be expected on the basis on their degree of genealogical relatedness}}
A sprachbund may also be called a linguistic area.
The languages in a sprachbund may or may not be related (but if they are related, the similarity must be stronger than the relatedness would predict)
SAE (Standard Average European) is a sprachbund of extensive common features in europe.
euroversal is a feature that exists in (almost) all SAE languages
Germanic, Romance, Baltic, Slavic, Finno-Ugric languages as well as albanian and greek are the languages normally classifed under which group?  SAE

#### cognates

Cognates are 2 or more words that have a common etymological origin.
Cognates often but not always have a similar meaning and a similar pronunciation.
False friends are words in different languages that look/sound similar and thus give off the impression of being cognates, but are unrelated.
Cognates in the same language are called doublets.

#### comparative linguistics

Comparative linguistics is a branch of historical linguistics that compares language to establish how they are related
Mutualll intelligibility is whether two speakers of different lects can understand each other {{c1::Without prior familiarity / special effort}}
The higher th elinguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility.

#### language families

##### IE

Indo-European languages descend from Proto-Indo-European (PIE)
{{c1::Indo-European languages}} can be most basically divided into {{c2::centum languages}} and {{c3::satem languages}}.
The {{c1::Germanic languages}} are subdivided into {{c2::east germanic languages}}, {{c3::north germanic languages}}, and {{c4::west germanic languages}}.

##### Altaic

Most linguists consider altaic to be a sprachbund, some consider it to be a language family.
The grouping of {{c4::Altaic}} languages (whether as a sprachbund or a language family) usually includes at least {{c1::Turkic}}, {{c2::Mongolic}}, and {{c3::Tongusic}} (this smaller grouping is sometimes called '{{c5::Micro}}-{{c4::altaic}}')
{{c3::Macro}}-altaic as a ({c4::very fringe}}) hypothesis also includes {{c1::japonic}} and {{c2::koreanic}}

### language change

#### semantic change

there are {{c2::many different types}} of {{c1::Semantic}} {{c1::change}}/{{c1::shift}}/{{c1::drift}} (= {{c1::the change of the meanings of words over time}} (the exact amount of which depends on {{c7::which classification scheme you follow}}).
Common types of {{c1::Semantic}} {{c1::change}}/{{c1::shift}}/{{c1::drift}} are {{c3::semantic narrowing}} (also called {{c4::specialization}}), {{c5::semantic widening}} (also called {{c6::generalization}}), {{c8::amelioration/elevation}}, {{c9::pejoration}}

##### types

{{c2::pejoration}}/{{c4::degeneration}} is a form of {{c1::Semantic}} {{c1::change}}/{{c1::shift}}/{{c1::drift}} (= {{c1::the change of the meanings of words over time}}) where {{c3::a word becomes more negative in meaning}}
{{c1::villain}} used to mean {{c2::serf, peasant}} - this is an example of {{c3::perjoration/degeneration}}
{{c1::knave}} used to mean {{c2::boy, child, servant}} - this is an example of {{c3::perjoration/degeneration}}

{{c2::amelioration}}/{{c4::elevation}} is a form of {{c1::Semantic}} {{c1::change}}/{{c1::shift}}/{{c1::drift}} (= {{c1::the change of the meanings of words over time}}) where {{c3::a word becomes more positive in meaning}}
{{c1::pretty}} used to mean {{c2::tricky, crafty, sly}} - this is an example of {{c3::amelioration/elevation}}
{{c1::Knight}} used to mean {{c2::boy, servant}} (thus cognate with german {{c2::knecht}})- this is an example of {{c3::amelioration/elevation}}

{{c2::Semantic widening}} aka {{c2::generalization}} is a form of {{c1::Semantic}} {{c1::change}}/{{c1::shift}}/{{c1::drift}} (= {{c1::the change of the meanings of words over time}}) where {{c3::a word becomes more general/less narrow in its meaning}} (often, {{c4::it takes on a meaning of one of its hypernyms}})
{{c1::bird}} used to mean {{c2::young bird, chick}} - this is an example of {{c3::semantic widening / generalization}}
{{c1::assassin}} used to mean {{c2::a member of the assassins chilling in the holy land}} - this is an example of {{c3::semantic widening / generalization}}

{{c2::Semantic narrowing}} aka {{c2::specialization}} is a form of {{c1::Semantic}} {{c1::change}}/{{c1::shift}}/{{c1::drift}} (= {{c1::the change of the meanings of words over time}}) where {{c3::a word becomes less general/more narrow in its meaning}} (often, {{c4::it takes on a meaning of one of its hyponyms}})
{{c1::to starve}} used to mean {{c2::to die}} (and thus is cognate with german {{c2::sterben}}) - this is an example of {{c3::semantic narrowing / specialization}}
{{c1::Wife}} used to primarily mean {{c2::woman (of any sort)}} - this is an example of {{c3::semantic narrowing / specialization}}
{{c1::Meat}} used to refer to {{c2::any food}} - this is an example of {{c3::semantic narrowing / specialization}}
{{c1::Deer}} used to refer to {{c2::all (esp. quadrupedal mammals) animals}} (and thus is cognate with german {{c2::Tier}}) - this is an example of {{c3::semantic narrowing / specialization}}



#### language contact

The field that studies language contact is contact linguistics.
Language convergence is a type of linguistic change in which languages come to structurally resemble one another why {{c1::due to prolonged language contact}}
In a language shift, a speech community switches to a different language.

##### dialects

Dialect levelling is the process of overall reduction in the distinctive features of a dialect towards {{c1::(more similarity with) the standard language}}
Since the industrial revolution, dialect levelling has been ocurring to most languages.

##### borrowing

AN element that seems to be a borrowing but isn't is called a pseudo-loan/pseudo-borrowing/false borrowing.
borrowing is the cover term for any kind of loan element.
narrative word|not a borrwoing
donor language|the language from which the word was borrowed

While weekend -&gt; {{c2::Wochenende}} is a {{c1::loan translation}}, skyscraper -&gt; {{c2::Wolkenkratzer}} is a {{c1::loan rendition/rendering}}
While a {{c1::loan translation}} / {{c1::calque}} {{c2::translates all the parts exactly}}, a {{c3::loan rendition/rendering}} {{c2::only uses approximate translation}}
{{c1::loan formation}} is a term usually used to group {{c2::any borrowing that uses foregin structure}} (i.e. {{c3::loan translations}} and {{c4::renditions}}, and depending on how you see them {{c5::loan creations}} as well), but {{c6::by far not by every author}}
{{c1::Loanblends}} can either be formed by {{c2::word with some semantic content}} + {{c2::some functional affix}} or {{c3::fusion of multiple words with semantic content}}. In the first case, they are seen to be {{c4::closer to loan words}}, in the other case they are seen to be {{c5::closer to loan translations/renditions (= loan formations)}}
{{c1::Loan creation}} is a bit of a vague term, but basically means {{c2::creation of a word}} using {{c3::native means}}, either to {{c4::fill a lack in the language which another language does not have}} or to {{c5::replace a borrowing}}
While I use {{c1::borrowing}} to mean {{c2::any sort of loaned thing}}, the term is {{c3::not always used in exactly this manner}}

#### Language death

Speakers choosing to abandon a language and it thus dying|language/linguisitic suicide
Causing languages to die out|linguicide

## discourse analysis

{{c1::Discourse analysis}} is the study of {{c2::real language use}}, in chunks {{c3::larger than the sentence}}
{{c1::Critical discourse analysis}} may be thought of {{c2::discourse analysis}} via / for use of {{c3::critical theory (lowercase)}}

## sociolinguistics

A spr<b>e</b>chbund is a&nbsp;group that has {{c1::a shared way of speaking}} going beyond language boundaries

note that unlike a sprachbund, this doesn't have to be geographically contiguous, and doesn't refer to whole languages, but just groups of speakers, and is generally not about vocabulary or grammar per se, but more about a more abstract manner
What might hip-hop with the characteristics of rapping, rhyme, and human beatboxing be an example of, if they occur in different langauges?  A sprechbund

In linguistics, backchanneling during a conversation occurs when one participant is speaking and another participant interjects responses to the speaker.
Backchannel responses are often phatic expressions.

In sociolinguistics, an accent is a manner of pronunciation peculiar to a particular individual, situation, or group.

### lects

a lect or variety is a version of a language spoken by a certain speech community
The term lect or variety avoids the term language, which people often associate with the idea of a standard variety.
Roughly, lects are mutually intelligible, but languages are not.
Register and style are both functional varieties.
Register and style a synonyms.
A register/style is a lect that is used for a particular purpose or in a particular communicative setting.


ideolect|a specific person

### code switching

Code-switching AKA language alternation
Code-switching is when a speaker does alternates between two lects/languages in a single conversation

### speech community

A speech community is a group of people who share a common lect.
The term speech community is generally used for groups which share a very specific lect, that is with precise norms, excpectations, etc.
A focused speech community is one where there is agreement about the shared varieties features
A diffuse speech community is one where there is less/little agreement about the shared varieties features
Each person belongs to many speech communities.

### language and social categories

#### language and gender

The study of language and gender is said to have stared with Language and Women's Place by Lakoff (1793ish)

### standartization

A standard variety/dialect/language is the version of a language which is standartized to a certain extent and thought to be/promoted as correct
A monocentric langauge is a language with one standard variety   
A pluricentric langauge is a language with multiple different standard varieties 
Monocnetric language|Japanese
Pluricentric language|English, German, Spanish  
The fact that english has BE and AE as well as many other standard forms of english makes it {{c1::a pluricentric language}}
Some of the the different standard varieties of german are {{c1::Standard german german, standard swiss german, standard austrian german}}

### value (?)

Linguistic prescription is establishing rules for the correct or good use of a language.

Prestige is the level of regard given to a thing within a given speech community
A lect with high prestige is called a prestige variety.
Prestige may be applied to lects or to smaller units such as words or grammatical constructs.
Most commonly, standard varieties are prestige varieties.
Covert prestige is the situation in which a non-standard variety has high prestige

Dialect as a term often implies negative value ('mere dialect').
People very confused may use dialect to mean accent.
In regions such as Italy, France and the Philippines separate but non-standard sister languages to the standard variety are called and (falsely) considered to be dialects.
In an academic setting, a dialect is either a synonym of variety/lect or for regiolect.

## multilingualism

A majority language is a language spoken by the majority of the population of an entity.
A minority language is a language spoken by a minority of the population of an entity.

### language transfer

Language transfer is the application of linguistic features from one language to another by {{c1::a bilingual or multilingual speaker}}
CLI (crosslinguistic influence) is roughly synonymous to language transfer.
negative language transfer is language transfer that results in errors
positive language transfer is language transfer that results in easier language learning.

### SLA

#### Heritage language

A heritage language is the former native language of a speaker that ends up being lost or underdeveloped due to another language, generally a majority language, being dominant.
People may have varying degrees of fluency in their heritage language.

### auxiliary languages

international auxiliary language and auxiliary language are synonyms.
IALs may also be called auxlangs.
IALs (international ausiliary languages) may include or exclude natural languages that are lingua franca.
Besides the case of natural languages that are lingua franca, IALs are constructed languages.
Interlingua is a naturalistic IAL enabled in part by the existence of SAE.

### Language birth

A pidgin is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common.
Pidgins often develop in trade situations.
Pidgins usually have a limited vocabulary and low presstige.
A pidgin is never spoken as a native language. 
The traditional view (has criticisms) is that a pidgin that is nativized becomes a creole.
A language gaining native speakers (from 0 to > 0) is known as nativization.
A mixed language is a language combining aspects of two or more languages but {{c1::not clearly deriving primarily from any single language&nbsp;}}

#### conlangs

Languages are either natural or constructed.
A conlang (constructed language) is one which was constructed by humans.
A natural language is one that has evolved naturally through human use.

Naturalistic conlangs mimic existing real languages.

### translingualism

Translingual phenomena are features of language that are relevant in more than one language. 
The International scientific vocabulary is the set fo science-related words that is  {{c1::used translingually}}

## linguistic typology

Linguistic typology (or language typology) is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features. 

### morphological typology 

Linguistic typology according to a language's morphological structures and mainly how these languages create words from morphemes is known as morphological typology.
The main distinction within morphological typology is the spectrum between analytic languages and synthetic languages.
Analytic languages contain very little inflection, and thus have very few morphemes per word (often close to one morpheme per word)
Synthetic languages contain a lot of inflection and thus have many morphemes per word.
Synthetic languages can be subdivided into (among others) agglutinative and fusional languages.
fusional languages merge many different inflectional categories into the same morpheme.
analytic languages have different morphemes for different inflectional categories and glue those together.
highly analytic|chinese, vietnamese
highly synthetic|japanese, turkish

### word order

Word order is how a language orders the syntacic constituents of a language.
Word order may be a distinguishing characteristic in linguistic typology.
Even languages which typically allow large amounts of flexibility in word order generally have a typical word order, where having a different order is considered marked.

#### constituent order

the constituent order of a clause, namely the relative order of subject, object, and verb, is one way to distinguish word order.
SOV, SVO, etc

Verb-final language place the verb at the end of a clause.

V2 word order

A linguistic universal is a pattern that occurs systematically across (most often all) natural languages.

## cross-cutting concerns

### implicational scale

{{c1::Implicational scale}} is a term that means if {{c2::one feature is present}}, {{c3::all the features}} {{c4::lower on the scale}} {{c5::will be as well}}
<img class="c2-f c1-b" src="mplicational-scale-of-basic-color-terms.png"><br/>{{c1::}}   an <b>implicational scale </b>(of basic color terms)
<img class="c2-f c1-b" src="sm_2021-10-21--08-21-02-screenshot.jpg"><br/>{{c1::}}   an <b>implicational scale </b> (of syntactic figures in Irish)
If a thing is on an {{c1::implicational scale}}, and we find that {{c2::the e.g. 5th stage is present}}, we would expect to also find {{c3::all four lower stages to be present}}.
{{c1::Most linguistic areas}} have things that can be on an implicational scale

### feature

In contemporary linguistics, the term feature is used in several ways. Two main uses can be distinguished:

The term feature is sometimes used for a specific dimension of classification along which a given linguistic item is categorized. The specification of this dimension is then called a value. For example, the English noun bread carries the value '+' for the feature [countability].
More generally, the term feature is also used as an equivalent of 'property', esp. when used for the classification of linguistic items. For example, the English phoneme /d/ can be said to have the feature [voiced] (i.e. the property of being voiced).
