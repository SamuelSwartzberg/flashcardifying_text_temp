# SGML/XML/HTML

SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language.
XML is a subset of SGML.
HTML was originally based on SGML, though the relationship has sometimes been fraught.
Since XML is a subset of SGML and HTML is based on it, HTML and XML share similarities in syntax.

SGML/XML/HTML <dfn>tags</dfn> are delimited by &lt;...&gt;
SGML/XML/HTML end tags additionally feature a / to look like &lt;.../&gt;
An SGML/XML/HTML <dfn>element</dfn> is everything from an elements start tag to an elments end tag.
An SGML/XML/HTML element has an <dfn>element name</dfn>.
An SGML/XML/HTML elements start and end tag feature its name: &lt;foo&gt; ... &lt;/foo&gt;.
SGML/XML/HTML elements are begun by a <dfn>start tag</dfn> and ended by an <dfn>end tag</dfn>, unless they are self-closing.
SGML/XML/HTML element consist of start tag, content, and end tag.
SGML/XML/HTML elements' <dfn>content</dfn> is either text or other elements ('child elements').
SGML/XML/HTML content goes between the start and the end tag.
<dfn>Empty elments</dfn> are created by (or a synonym to) self-closing tags.
Self-closing tags in SGML/XML/HTML only consist of a start tag.
Self-closing tags must end /&gt; in XML.
Self-closing tags may end /&gt; or merely &gt; in HTML.
Using a closing tag for self-closing tags is usually invalid.
Empty elements cannot have content, since there is nowhere to put it.

Whitespace within tags is usually ignored, as long as its not within a tag name or attribute
an HTML element name may only 

SGML/XML/HTML attributes are placed in the start tag.
SGML/XML/HTML attributes have the syntax key="value".
HTML attribute values may be unquoted if they do not feature whitespace and a few reserved characters.
HTML features boolean attributes: attributes which <em>may not</em> take a value, but whose presence or absence represnets true or false.
HTML also features enumerated attriubtes: attributes that take a fixed set of values.
Confusingly, some HTML attributes with boolean semantics are not boolean attributes, but instead enumerated attributes, mostly with the possible values "yes" and "no" or "true" and "false".

SGML/XML/HTML element names may be in any case.
in HTML, putting element names in all lower case is common.
XML element names may contain any unicode with the exception of some metacharacters.
HTML and SVG built-in element names only contain characters a-z.
HTML custom elements must start with a character a-z in lowercase, must contain at least a hyphen character, but otherwise may contain any unicode.

SGML/XML/HTML documents contain exactly one root element. All other elements are contained in the root element.
The SGML/XML/HTML root element has the same name as the relevant language (i.e. html for html, xml for xml, svg for svg)

## doctype

A document type declaration, or doctype, is an instruction that associates a particular XML or SGML document (for example, a webpage) with a document type definition (DTD).
A document type declaration must be the first thing in the page if HTML.
A document type declaration must be the first thing after the XML declaration if XML
The syntax of a doctype declaration is &lt;!DOCTYPE somestuff&gt;
In HTML 5, the doctype no longer actually references a DTD, but merely prevents the browser from switching into quirks mode.

## HTML

### General structure

An HTML document is started by the &lt;html&gt; tag and ended by the &lt;/html&gt; tag.
a &lt;html&gt; element consists of a &lt;head&gt; section and a &lt;body&gt;

### <head>

The &lt;head&gt; in HTML contains metadata about the document.
it can contain:
the &lt;title&gt; element, which defines the documents title
the &lt;title&gt; element is mainly shown in the browsers tab name / title bar, as well as search engines.
the &lt;title&gt; element can only contain text, not tags.

### Media

&lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; embed a video/audio media player.
Both HTMLVideoElement and HTMLAudioElement inherit from HTMLMediaElement.
The {{c1::HTMLMediaElement}} has a bunch of properties, amongs others

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>((c:2;::muted))</td>
<td>((c:7;::Indicates whether the audio is muted))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>((c:3;::paused))</td>
<td>((c:8;::Indicates whether it is paused))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>((c:4;::ended))</td>
<td>((c:9;::Indicates whether it has finished playing))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>((c:5;::loop))</td>
<td>((c:10;::Indicates whether it will loop))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>((c:6;::playbackRate))</td>
<td>((c:11;::Represents the speed at which the thing is playing))</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You may define a single source for &lt;video&gt; or &lt;audio&gt; via a src element.
You may define multiple sources for &lt;video&gt; or &lt;audio&gt; via child &lt;source&gt; elements.
&lt;track&gt; defines text tracks for media elements (&lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;)
&lt;source&gt; elements for audio/video take their URL in a src attribute.

### source

the type of a &lt;source&gt; element is specified via the type attriube, or else the browser will check the MIME type in the HTTP header 

### Headings

&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; define headings.
It is an antipattern to skip heading levels between &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h6&gt;
There may only be one &lt;h1&gt; per page, which should describe the overall purpose of the page.
Skipping heading levels between &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h6&gt; results in bad accessibility and SEO heading levels

### del and ins 

The &lt;del&gt; HTML element represents text that has been deleted from a document.
The &lt;ins&gt; HTML element represents text that has been added to the document.
The &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; elements are often used for purposes such as tracking changes or source code diffs.

### progress and meter

<pre><code>&lt;<span class="c1-cloze">progress</span> id="file" <span class="c2-cloze">max</span>="100" <span class="c3-cloze">value</span>="70"&gt; 70% &lt;/<span class="c1-cloze">progress</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<span class="cloze-dump">{{c1::}}{{c2::}}{{c3::}}</span><br><div class="sub">
<div class="sub c1-f c2-b">
<progress id="file" max="100" value="70"> 70% </progress>
</div>
</div>
A progress bar shows the progress of a task via a bar that becomes fuller as the task nears completion.
In HTML, a progress bar can be indicated by &lt;progress&gt;
In HTML, meter generally displays as a bar of varying fullness.
In HTML, meter supposedly represents a scalar value within a known range.
In HTML, meter accepts min, max, low, high, optimum and value to specify the constraints of the scalar value defined.
In HTML, progress only accepts max and value as attributes, reflecting the semantics of the completion of a task.
In HTML both progress and meter support a fallback text value within their tags.

### tables

table > tbody/thead/tfoot (optional level, but if used, any tr must be within it)
tbody/thead/tfoot > tr
tr > th/td

### forms



#### input

specifying the value property of an input element in HTML sets its initial value.
As the state of <input>s changes, the value property in JS is updated.

##### types

###### radio & checkbox

A radio button is a graphical control element that allows the user to choose only one of a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. 
In HTML, a radio button is realized by <input type="radio">
In HTML, multiple radio buttons are linked by assigning them the same number.

Bootstrap:

.form-check # set of radio buttons
.form-check-label   define a label for a checkbox/radio button
.form-check-input   define a checkbox/radio button

### Ruby 

ruby text/characters are small annotative glosses placed on the top or to the right of characters.
Ruby text/characters is called furigana in japanese.
In HTML, ruby text is delimited by the &lt;ruby&gt; tag
In HTML ruby annotation, the syntax is &lt;ruby&gt;lowertext&lt;rt&gt;uppertext&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
In HTML, one may designate fallback delimiters for the upper text. 
Ruby fallback delimiters are enclosed in &lt;rp&gt; tags, and go before and after the &lt;rt&gt; delimited uppertext.

### aside

An aside (there is no agreed-upon term, so I'm using the term that HTML uses) is a part of the main content thats only partially related to the main content, and often placed outside of the main flow. 
A pull quote is an aside that is a quote from the article.

### figure

In general, figures are images/diagrams/similar with a caption.
In general, figures float (in the general sense).
In HTML, the <figure> element specifies its caption with <figcaption>

### float

a float is across styling languages a thing that exists outside of the normal flow of text.

float places an element at one side of the container or next to another floating element, allowing text/inline elements to wrap around it.
float: left/right makes the element go to the left/right side of the container/the next float respectively.
A floating element is where the (computed) value of float is not none.
Float implies display: block, and converts it if required.
The clear CSS property sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared) floating elements that precede it. 
the clear property applies to clearing all floats if set to both, or to only clearing left/right floats if set to left or right.
If element contains only floated elements, its height will collapse to nothing.
To prevent and element containing only floated elements height collapsing to nothing, a technique called a clearfix is used.
The most common clearfix technique might be: ::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}

### Lists

In HTML and Latex, ordered and unordered lists are surrounded with something different, but use the same list items.
Latex uses the same list items for description lists also, while HTML uses different elements for those.
by default, latex only allows the nesting of lists to a depth of four

ordered list|enumerate environment|&lt;ol>
unordered list|itemize environment|&lt;ul>
description list|description environment|&lt;dl>
list item|\item|&lt;li>

### HTML interface

any HTML element has a JS interface that is called HTMLSomeelementnameElement.

### Common attributes

the <code>datetime</code> attribute specifies the date and time associated with the element
<code>datetime</code> is an attribute taken by &lt;del&gt;, &lt;ins&gt;, and &lt;time&gt;

The <code>cite</code> attribute provides an URI that points to the source of a quote or change.
The <code>cite</code> attribute can be used on &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;ins&gt;, &lt;del&gt;

rel
target

#### Global attributes

Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.
Kinds of global attributes:
aria-*
the onevent event handlers
xml:lang/xml:base — these are inherited from the XHTML specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.

class, id
HTML Microdata properties: item*
translate: an enumerated attribute whether the element should be translated, e.g. by tools such as google translate.

tabindex:
The tabindex attriubte indicates if and how an element can be focused by the keyboard.
&nbsp;{{c1::tabindex}}{{c2::=0}} indicates that {{c3::an element can be focused}} (e.g.&nbsp;{{c4::by the tab key}})
&nbsp;{{c1::tabindex}}{{c2::=-1}} indicates that {{c3::an element can <b>not&nbsp;</b>be focused}} (e.g. by {{c4::the tab key}})
Values of tabindex larger than 0 specify the order in which things can be tabbed, use of this is highly discouraged.
CSS inline styling with style.
part and slot for the shadow DOM.
`is` for custom elements.
nonce
lang
hidden semantically indicates that the element is not relevant at the moment.
hidden in fact just sets display to none.
draggable is an enumerated attriubte w/ "true" and "false" which indicates whether the element can be dragged using the Drag and Drop API
data-* 
dir: enumerated attriubte ltr/rtl/auto
contenteditable
the title attribute is *generally* shown as a tooltip, unless the element implements title differently.

##### text editing only

spellchek and inputmode attributes that are global attributes, but only can usefully be used where text can be inputed in html.
there are three places where text can be inputed in HTML: <input type="text">, <textarea> and anything w/ contenteditable
spellcheck: an enumerated attribute w/ "true" and "false" whether to check the spelling of the thing
inputmode: specify the kind of text input that is required, thus allowing mobile devices to show appropriate soft keyboards
inputmode is different from <input type="... in that it does not enforce any kind of validation, users *can* still input anything they want.
inputmode value|shows|equivalent <input> type
none|no virtual keyboard
text|default virtual keyboard
decimal|keyboard with digits and decimal separtors, perhaps a -
numeric|keyboard with digits only, perhaps a -
tel|a telephone keyboard: 0-9, *, and #|type="tel"
search|return key may be labelled search, perhaps other changes|type="search"
email|optimized for email entry, contains @ prominently|type="email"
url|optimized for url entry|type="url"

autofocus
autocapitalize: capitalization of user input
enterkeyhint: is an enumerated attribute defining what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.
