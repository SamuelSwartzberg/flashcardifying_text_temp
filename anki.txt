At its most general, parsing is taking strings and extracting information. In programming, parsing is often used for extracting a bit of useful data out of a string. In natural and computer languages, parsing takes a series of tokens and transforms them into some kind of data structure. In natural and computer languages, parsing is also called syntax/syntactic analysis. The data structure that parsing results in dependss on the input data. Parsing a CSV file may result in a list of records. Parsing natural or programming/markup/whatever languages often results in a tree. This tree is called a parse tree for programming/markup/whatever languages and syntax tree for natural language. The tokens for parsing/syntactic analysis in the lexical analysis sense are generated by lexical analysis/tokenization. After parsing/syntactic analysis comes semantic analysis. a parse tree is the result of {{c1::a derivation}} of a context-free grammar. {{c1::a syntax tree}} is a form of parse tree most common in linguistics.

"\{{c1::stackrel}}{{c2::{top}{bot} }} will {{c3::render the top text above the bottom text}} In Latex, there are a bunch of commands starting with \text (which I will call \textwhatever) that indicate different fontstyles: \textbf, \textit, \textrm (roman), \texttt (monospace), \textsc (smallcaps) If you try to type text in a math env as-is, it will look weird, as latex is formatting it for math. To insert text in a math environment, you can use any of \mathwhatever, \textwhatever, or just \text. It is generally advised that you use \text or \textwhatever within math environments when you want to write text, and \mathwhatever when you want to write math that just happens to be in roman letters. For many but not all \textwhatever font formatting commands, latex has corresponding \mathwhatever fonts (e.g. \mathrm, \math. The \mathwhatever fonts only work within a math environment. The \textwhatever fonts also work within a math environment. Within a math environment, there are some differences between \mathwhatever and \texthatever:  \mathwhatever uses the defined math font and \textwhatever uses the defined text font (which may be different) \mathwhatever does not preserve spaces within, but \textwhatever does. you can nest \textwhatevers but not \mathwhatevers. some text styles only exist as \mathwhatevers, e.g. mathfrak (Fraktur), mathbb (Blackboard bold)  In math environments, besides using \textbf or \mathbf, you can bold symbols by using \boldsymbol or \pmb 'poor man's bold' (which however only works by duplicating characters 3 times slightly offset)  frac{a}{b}   fraction (bruch)||<img src=""sm_JFBz6.png""> sqrt[root]{math}   square root (wurzel) \sum_lower^upper  There are also commands for math functions that are pure text (e.g. sin, lim), which have the advantage over just typing the characters that proper formatting is guaranteed  For commands (esp. math) that take something lower, it is often indicated {{c1::_{foo}}} For commands (esp. math) that take something upper, it is often indicated {{c1::^{foo}}}  \bar{foo}|ad a bar on top of letter <div class='c2-f'> What does this indicate? </div><div class='c1-f'> How do we indicate this in latex? </div><br/>{{c1::x^{n}}}  <span class=""divider"">&lt;-&gt;</span> {{c2::x<sup>n</sup>}}<br/><div class=""sub""> <div class=""sub c2-f c1-b"" > for single characters {} are optional </div> </div> <div class='c2-f'> What does this command do? </div><div class='c1-f'> Command for this? </div><br/>((h:2;::<img src=""sm_403-4037364_6848425-integral-symbol.png"">)) ((h:2;::<img src=""sm_1200px-Greek_uc_sigma.svg.png"">)){{c1::int}}  <span class=""divider"">&lt;-&gt;</span> {{c2::integral}} {{c1::sum}}  <span class=""divider"">&lt;-&gt;</span> {{c2::render a sum}} <div class='c2-f'> What does this command do? </div><div class='c1-f'> Command for this? </div><br/>((h:2;::<img src=""sm_uNgnp.png"">)){{c1::overbrace}}  <span class=""divider"">&lt;-&gt;</span> {{c2::horizontal curly brace on top}} <div class='c2-f'> What does this command do? </div><div class='c1-f'> Command for this? </div><br/>((h:2;::<img src=""sm_binomial-coefficient-formula.png"">)){{c1::binom}}  <span class=""divider"">&lt;-&gt;</span> {{c2::binomial coefficient}}"	acad::latex

Selecting Shadow Hosts from within a Shadow Tree A shadow host is outside of the shadow tree it hosts, and so would ordinarily be untargettable by any selectors evaluated in the context of the shadow tree (as selectors are limited to a single tree), but it is sometimes useful to be able to style it from inside the shadow tree context.  For the purpose of Selectors, a shadow host also appears in its shadow tree, with the contents of the shadow tree treated as its children. (In other words, the shadow host is treated as replacing the shadow root node.)  When considered within its own shadow trees, the shadow host is featureless. Only the :host, :host(), and :host-context() pseudo-classes are allowed to match it.  Why is the shadow host so weird? The shadow host lives outside the shadow tree, and its markup is in control of the page author, not the component author.  It would not be very good if a component used a particular class name internally in a shadow tree stylesheet, and the page author using the component accidentally also used the same class name and put it on the shadow host. Such a situation would result in accidental styling that is impossible for the component author to predict, and confusing for the page author to debug.  However, there are still some reasonable use-cases for letting a stylesheet in a shadow tree style its shadow host. (For example, the component might want to be laid out as a flexbox, requiring the shadow host to be set to display: flex.) So, to allow this situation but prevent accidental styling, the shadow host appears but is completely featureless and unselectable except through :host and its related functional forms, which make it very explicit when you’re trying to match against markup provided by the page author.

chakra does most of {{c2::its config}} in the the {{c1::<code>config</code> property of <code>theme</code>}}	acad::chakra-ui
 Chakra stores the color mode in the browser in {{c1::localStorage}}	acad::chakra-ui
{{c1::Color mode}} is chakras way for managing {{c2::light and dark mode}}. It accepts the values {{c3::light}}, {{c3::dark}}, and {{c3::system}}	acad::chakra-ui
the {{c5::<code>config</code> property of <code>theme</code>}} takes {{c1::<code>initialColorMode</code>}} to tell the app {{c2::in which color mode to start}}, and {{c3::<code>useSystemColorMode</code>}} {{c4::whether to respond to the color theme system preference}}	acad::chakra-ui
{{c1::&lt;ColorModeScript&gt;}} is necessary {{c2::for color mode in chakra to work}}, and needs to be {{c3::one of the first things in the &lt;body&gt;}}	acad::chakra-ui
{{c1::useColorMode}} is a React {{c2::hook}} that gives you access to {{c3::colorMode}}, {{c3::toggleColorMode}}	acad::chakra-ui
{{c1::useColorModeValue}} is a React hook used to {{c2::change any value or style based on the color mode}}. It {{c4::takes 2 arguments}}: {{c3::the value in light mode}}, and {{c3::the value in dark mode}}.	acad::chakra-ui
In some occasions, you might want Chakra components to {{c1::look the same in both light and dark modes}}. To achieve this, {{c3::wrap the component}} in a {{c2::LightMode}} or {{c2::DarkMode}} component. 	acad::chakra-ui
if using {{c2::SSR/Static generation}} with {{c4::Nextjs}} and {{c4::Chakra}} {{c3::color mode}} together, {{c1::some additional boilerplate}} is required	acad::chakra-ui
{{c3::Chakra UI}}&nbsp; converts {{c2::theme tokens (colors, font sizes, stc)}} to {{c1::CSS variables}}.	acad::chakra-ui
"Chakra's {{c1::css variables}} are prefixed with {{c2::chakra-}}"	acad::chakra-ui

(based off the System UI Theme Specification) to have a style prop change based on {{c1::breakpoints}}, you can either pass an {{c2::array}}, with each value being {{c3::the one for that breakpoint}} (starting from {{c4::the unnamed smallest one}}) and {{c5::pass null}} to {{c6::skip breakpoints}} and thus avoid {{c6::generating unnecessary css}}, or pass an {{c2::object}} with keys with {{c7::the breakpoint names}} and the values as the relevant values	acad::chakra-ui

if you want {{c1::base html elements}} (e.g. {{c1::button}}) to {{c2::accept style props styling}}, use {{c3::&lt;chakra.&lt;element&gt;}} (e.g. {{c3::&lt;chakra.button}})	acad::chakra-ui
the chakra {{c1::factory}} function <code>chakra()</code> takes {{c2::a react component}} (or {{c2::html tag}}) and optionally an argument of {{c3::props}}, and makes it into a {{c4::chakra style-props aware component}}. Since it uses <code>{{c5::emotion}}</code> under the hood, {{c2::the react component}} needs to {{c6::accept className as props}} or it will not work	acad::chakra-ui
"By using {{c1::ChakraProvider}} at the root of your application, we automatically render a {{c2::GlobalStyle}} component, which reads the styles defined in {{c3::theme.styles.global}} and {{c4::passes them}} to {{c5::emotion's Global component}} which is used to handle global style injection."	acad::chakra-ui
to set {{c3::global styles}} for things in chakra, use {{c4::theme.styles.global}}. There, every key is {{c1::a selector}}, and every property is a {{c2::set of declarations}}	acad::chakra-ui

"the {{c1::colorScheme}} property of a {{c2::component}} takes a {{c3::color name}} (of the ones that define {{c4::palettes}}, in {{c5::<code>theme.colors</code>}}), it then uses {{c6::different weights}} for {{c7::different parts of itself}}<br/><div class=""sub""> <div class=""sub all-b"">If you give a Button component, for example, a colorScheme of ""red"", it uses the different palette ranges for its color and hover, disabled, active pseudo-classes.</div> </div>"	acad::chakra-ui

the same mechanism that allows you to {{c1::customize built-in chakra components}} (i.e. setting things such as {{c2::baseStyle}}, {{c2::variant}}, {{c2::defaultProps}} etc. in {{c3::theme.component.somename}}) allows you to {{c4::create new chakra components}}, but you also need to {{c5::implement the react component}}	acad::chakra-ui

By extension, a »⟮dog whistle⟯« in politics is (the use of) ⟮coded language⟯ which ⟮sounds innocent to most people⟯ (or ⟮at least allows plausible deniability⟯) but ⟮is meant to communicate a specific thing to an intended audience⟯.  Examples for ⟮＿dog whistles＿⟯ are ⟮""international bankers""⟯ to mean ⟮jews⟯, or ⟮c-;states' rights⟯ as code for ⟮segregation/racism/pro-slavery⟯   #### weasel words  A »⟮weasel word/phrase⟯« is a word or phrase used to ⟮create the impression⟯ that ⟮a strong claim has been made⟯, when ⟮c-;in fact⟯ ⟮only a vague and thus weak claim has been made⟯. Most commonly ⟮＿weasel words/phrases＿⟯ are created via ⟮vague or weakening quantifiers⟯, ⟮unclarity about referents⟯ or ⟮use of the passive voice⟯.  Examples of weasel words: - A growing body of evidence suggests (Unclarity about referents - what evidence?) - People are saying/Critics claim/... (Unclarity about referents - who?) - It is recommended that (Passive voice - who is recommending?) - [It is] officially known as (Passive voice - what is the official body here?) - Often, x may (Vague or weaking quantifier - in which circumstances?)  #### bothsidesism  »⟮Bothsidesing⟯« is a term where you ⟮present both sides of an argument with equal weight/fault⟯, eventhough ⟮one does actually merits more weight or has more fault⟯  ⟮＿Bothsidesing＿⟯ as a term is generally used as ⟮a criticsim⟯, especially ⟮of the media.⟯   #### washing  »⟮xwashing⟯« is a ⟮snowclone⟯ indicating ⟮manipulation of appearances/public opinion⟯ that ⟮a certain thing (mostly product)⟯ is ⟮x-supportive⟯ ⟮＿xwashing⟯＿ implies that ⟮the support for the issue symbolized by x⟯ is only ⟮surface-deep/calculated for profit⟯. examples of ⟮＿x-washing＿⟯: ⟮greenwashing (environmentalism), pinkwashing (LGBTQ)⟯ ⟮＿xwashing＿⟯ as a term stems from ⟮＿whitewashing＿⟯.  ##### whitewashing  »⟮whitewashing⟯« originally meant ⟮the application of whitewash (a lime and water mixture)⟯ to ⟮paint walls and fences bright white⟯. »⟮whitewashing⟯« was then extended to mean ⟮papering over unfavorable elements⟯. Finally, »⟮whitewashing⟯« has come to mean ⟮making something more palletable to white people⟯, esp. by ⟮casting POC as white people⟯.  ## freedom of speech  ### suppression of speech  #### impressumspflicht  An »⟮impressum⟯« is a section containing ⟮the contact information⟯ of ⟮the person responsible for the content.⟯  »⟮Impressumspflicht⟯« is ⟮the legal requirement⟯ for ⟮an impressum⟯. ⟮＿Impressumspflicht＿⟯ is generally only a thing in ⟮german-speaking countries⟯ The main law ⟮enforcing impressumspflicht⟯ in the internet is ⟮the Telemediengesetz⟯, if ⟮you are offering services⟯, also ⟮the Dienstleistungs-Informationspflichten-Verordnung⟯  An ⟮impressum⟯ must be ""⟮leicht erkennbar⟯, ⟮unmittelbar erreichbar⟯, ⟮ständig verfügbar⟯""  ^Historically, the German impressum requirement has its roots in the censorship laws of 19th century and earlier monarchies, and has been criticized as illiberal and contrary to the principle of free speech; in most other countries there is no comparable requirement.  #### chilling effect  A »⟮chilling effect⟯« is an effect that ⟮reduces or supresses⟯ ⟮certain actions⟯ by causing ⟮self-policing⟯.  ### paradox of tolerance  The »⟮paradox of tolerance⟯« states that ⟮if a society is tolerant without limit⟯, ⟮its ability to be tolerant⟯ is eventually ⟮seized or destroyed⟯ by ⟮the intolerant⟯.
