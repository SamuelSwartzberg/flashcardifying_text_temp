## marxist

### base and superstructure

In marxism, ⟮society⟯ ⟮consists of⟯ two parts, ⟮the ＿base＿⟯ and ⟮the ＿superstructure＿⟯.
The »⟮base⟯« consists of ⟮forces and relations of production⟯.
The »⟮superstructure⟯« consists of ⟮culture, institutions, rituals, states, etc.⟯
In marxism, the ⟮base and superstructure⟯ ⟮reciprocally influence each other⟯, but ⟮the base is predominant⟯.

### universal equivalent

»⟮the universal equivalent⟯« is ⟮the measure⟯ by which ⟮all commodities⟯ are ⟮compared and exchanged⟯ 
To marx, ⟮money⟯ is the thing that eventually takes over the role of ⟮the universal equivalent⟯ in capitalism.

### value

To ⟮marx⟯, the ⟮exchange value⟯ of a good is ⟮how it can be exchanged for other commodities⟯
To ⟮marx⟯, the ⟮use value⟯ of a good is ⟮its tangible features/physical properties⟯ that  ⟮fulfill human needs/wants⟯
form|corresp. value|explanation
⟮natural form⟯|⟮use value⟯|⟮actual tangible form (the actual physical form, e.g. cloth, iron, etc.⟯)
⟮value form⟯|⟮exchange value⟯|⟮a good in relation to different commodities (e.g. 20 yards of linen = 1 coat⟯)

### labor

#### reproductive labor

»⟮reproductive labor⟯« is the work that ⟮reproduces other labor⟯.
⟮＿Reproductive labor＿⟯ is ⟮absolutely necessary⟯ - without ⟮c-;reproductive labor⟯, there ⟮would be no labor at all⟯.
⟮＿Reproductive labor＿⟯ consists of ⟮chores⟯ and ⟮childrearing⟯.

⟮Fountain⟯ is  a markup language for ⟮screenplays⟯ inspired by ⟮markdown⟯ 

###### title page

In fountain, a ⟮title page⟯ consists of ⟮key-values pairs⟯, ⟮hb;separated internally by ⟮:⟯.⟯ 
In fountain's title page you can have ⟮multiple of the same key⟯. the value can ⟮stretch over multiple lines⟯, ⟮hb;if it does, ⟮lines beyond the first⟯ should be ⟮preceded by 3 or more spaces, or a tab⟯. ⟯ 
In fountain, the ⟮title page⟯ is optional, but must be ⟮the first thing in the document if it appears⟯. 

###### parantheticals

In screenplays, ⟮parantheticals⟯ are ⟮the annotations in parentheses⟯, generally ⟮between⟯ ⟮a characters name⟯ and ⟮their dialogue⟯. 
⟮parathenticals⟯ are ⟮centered⟯, as are ⟮the character name⟯, and ⟮the dialogue after.⟯ 
In screenplays, ⟮characters names⟯ are written in ⟮all caps⟯ when ⟮above dialogue elements⟯ and when ⟮they first appear⟯, and ⟮in normal case afterwards⟯. 
In fountain, an ⟮all-caps line⟯ automatically becomes ⟮a charater element⟯ ⟮(c:16;a character name before dialogue⟯) unless ⟮it has a good reason not to⟯. 
In fountain, you indicate ⟮a paranthetical⟯ by ⟮surrounding it in (⟯). 
In fountain, anything ⟮after a paranthetical element⟯ or ⟮after a character element⟯ ⟮automatically becomes dialogue⟯.

### birth rate/fertility

The ⟮different fertility rates are⟯ sometimes presented ⟮as-is⟯ (as ⟮a percentage⟯), or ⟮multiplied by 1000⟯, to ⟮present a number/index⟯ 

What we often call ⟮birth rate⟯ is more properly called the ⟮crude birth rate⟯, because ⟮it isn't directly based on anything related to childbirth⟯ 
The ⟮crude birth rate⟯ is ⟮the number of live births⟯ ⟮per person⟯ 
To get ⟮the crude birth rate⟯ in practice, we ⟮divide the number of live births through the population size⟯ 

The ⟮general fertility rate⟯ is ⟮the amount of live births⟯ ⟮per women aged 15 to 44 (women of childbearing age⟯) 

The ⟮age-specific fertility rate⟯ is ⟮the number of births⟯ ⟮to women in a given age group⟯ ⟮divided by the number of women in a given age group⟯ 
The ⟮ASFR⟯ is often ⟮grouped in groups of⟯ ⟮1⟯ or ⟮5⟯ ⟮years⟯. 
In plain language, the ⟮ASFR⟯ e.g. for age 21 is ⟮the amount of children an average 21 y/o has in a year⟯ 

The ⟮TFR⟯ measures ⟮babies per woman (in her lifetime⟯) (*) 
Mathematically, the ⟮total fertility rate⟯ is ⟮the sum of all⟯ ⟮current age-specific fertility rates⟯ 
In plain language, the ⟮TFR⟯ is ⟮the sum of⟯ ⟮the amount of chilren⟯ ⟮a women will have⟯ ⟮in any given year of her life⟯ 
The thing the ⟮total fertility rate⟯ is ⟮trying to estimate⟯ is ⟮the amount of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime (subject to some theoretical assumptions⟯) 
The ⟮total fertility rate⟯ assumes that ⟮the woman will survive until the end of her reproductive life⟯ and that ⟮she will to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime⟯ 
If a ⟮woman dies before her reproductive period ends (lets say at 30),⟯ she ⟮will not impact ASFRs beyond 30⟯. This is not a problem until ⟮we add them together to the TFR⟯ - since we are using the ASFRs to ⟮estimate how many children a woman will have in her life⟯, ⟮the ASFRs⟯ ⟮should be impacted b⟯⟮y the woman who died before the end of the reproductive period (the dead women should count as 0⟯). Therefore, ⟮maternal mortality distorts the TFR⟯. 


The ⟮replacement rate / replacement-level fertility⟯ is ⟮the TFR⟯ ⟮needed to sustain population levels⟯ 
A ⟮TFR⟯ ⟮below replacement rate⟯ is known as ⟮Sub-replacement fertility⟯ 
Beyond ⟮the distorting factors for the TFR⟯, ⟮the replacement rate⟯ is additionally distorted by ⟮child mortality⟯. 
⟮The replacement rate⟯ for countries ⟮with low child and maternal mortality⟯ is ⟮about 2.1⟯.

### dependency

#### definition of dependent

In demographics/economics, a ⟮dependent⟯ is someone ⟮who relies on someone else for financial support.⟯
For statistical purposes, it is generally assumed that ⟮those aged 15-64⟯ are ⟮non-dependents⟯, and ⟮those aged 0-14 and 65-⟯ are ⟮dependents⟯.
The relationship of ⟮dependents per non-dependent⟯ is expressed ⟮in the dependency ratio⟯.

#### dependency ratio

The ⟮dependency ratio (amount of people who work divided by people who can't⟯) is used as a proxy for ⟮pressure on the productive population⟯,
A ⟮lower⟯ ⟮dependency ratio⟯ is generally better because it often results in ⟮economic growth⟯.
When ⟮a change to a lower dependency ratio leads to economic growth⟯, which is most often caused when there is a ⟮high fertility rate⟯, resulting in ⟮a bunch of young people⟯, followed by ⟮a decrease in fertility⟯, and often ⟮augmented by an increase in life expectancy⟯, this is termed a ⟮demographic dividend⟯.
the idea of a ⟮demographic dividend⟯ is used to explain e.g. ⟮China's rapid economic growth⟯ - in ⟮2010⟯ they had an unprecedented ⟮dependency ratio⟯ of ⟮35%⟯, at the a time where the world average was ⟮53%⟯.
Of course, ⟮this large group of young people⟯ responsible for a ⟮demographic dividend⟯ will ⟮eventually grow old⟯, with ⟮less young people to support them⟯, leading to ⟮an increased dependency ratio⟯. this has been termed the ⟮demographic tax⟯ or ⟮demographic burden⟯.
A ⟮demographic burden/tax results⟯ in ⟮lower economic growth⟯ - a fact ⟮Japan⟯ ⟮is currently experiencing⟯ and ⟮China⟯ ⟮probably will fall victim to as well⟯.

### sex/gender

#### missing women

The term "⟮missing women⟯" (coined by ⟮Amartya Sen⟯) indicates a shortfall in ⟮the number of women⟯ relative to ⟮the expected number of women⟯ in ⟮a region or country⟯. 
⟮missing women⟯ are often measured/discovered through ⟮male-to-female sex ratios⟯, specifically via ⟮the deviance from⟯ the ⟮natural roughly 1:1 m:f ratio (in fact, in the west it is generally 0.98:1⟯) 
⟮Sen⟯ argued that there were about ⟮100 million⟯ ⟮"missing women"⟯ in ⟮Asia⟯. 
The phenomenon of ⟮missing women⟯ and is theorized to be caused by ⟮sex-selective abortions⟯, ⟮female infanticide⟯, and ⟮inadequate healthcare and nutrition for female children⟯. 
The fact of the existence of missing women is caused by ⟮sexism⟯, and may be seen as a pretty direct expression of ⟮their -value status.⟯

######### omega-3

There are three types of ⟮omega-3⟯ fatty acids, ⟮ALA⟯, ⟮EPA⟯, and ⟮DHA⟯.
of the ⟮three⟯ types of ⟮omega-3⟯ fatty acids relevant to human nutrition, only ⟮ALA⟯ is ⟮essential⟯.

Of the omega-3 fatty acids, only ⟮ALA⟯ is essential since ⟮EPA⟯ and ⟮DHA⟯ can be ⟮synthesized from the former⟯.
⟮EPA/DHA synthesis from ALA⟯ may be impaired in ⟮aging⟯ and generally is not a ⟮particularly efficient process⟯, as such, ⟮making sure to consume EPA/DHA⟯ is probably advisable.

#### micro

##### genesis

⟮Minerals⟯ ⟮end up in food⟯ via ⟮rock, soil, and water,⟯ which are ⟮absorbed by plants as they grow (or e.g. by animals licking rocks⟯), and then ⟮passed further up the food chain⟯. 
⟮What minerals we get⟯ from plants/animals depends on ⟮which they can store⟯, but also ⟮what the soil/animals further down the food chain had in them⟯. 
⟮Vitamins⟯ are ⟮biosynthesized⟯ by ⟮plants/animals⟯ and then ⟮absorbed by us⟯. 
⟮Which vitamins⟯ are ⟮contained in food⟯ depend on ⟮what the relevant vegetable or animal can biosythesize⟯. 

##### vitamins

Theoretically, all ⟮vitamins⟯ are defined to be ⟮essential nutrients⟯, however ⟮Vitamin D⟯ can be synthesized if ⟮exposed to sunlight (specifically UVB rays⟯), and is thus ⟮an exception⟯ 
Most ⟮vitamins⟯ are not ⟮single molecules⟯, but ⟮groups of related molecules⟯ which are each called ⟮vitamers⟯ 
Each ⟮vitamin⟯ is typically used in ⟮multiple reactions⟯, and therefore ⟮most have multiple functions⟯. 
⟮Vitamin B12⟯ is ⟮the only⟯ vitamin or nutrient ⟮not available from plant sources.⟯ 
⟮Vitamins⟯ are generally categorized as either ⟮water⟯- or ⟮fat⟯ soluble 
The ⟮water-soluble vitamins (the 8 B vitamins and vitamin C⟯) are ⟮easily excreted from the body⟯, thus generally ⟮hypervitaminosis (if referring to high storage levels⟯) is not an issue, therefore, however, ⟮consistent consumption is required⟯. 
Of the ⟮fat-soluble⟯ vitamins, ⟮A⟯ and ⟮D⟯ can ⟮accumulate in the body to a dangerous level⟯, resulting in ⟮hypervitaminosis⟯ 
⟮Hypervitaminosis⟯ is a condition of abnormally high ⟮storage levels (most of the time, although some sources also just use it for any overdose⟯) of ⟮vitamins⟯ 
In general, ⟮excess intake⟯ of vitamins is ⟮unlikely⟯ from ⟮food sources⟯, but possible via ⟮supplements⟯ 



Common Designation|More Properly
⟮Vitamin C⟯|⟮Ascorbic acid⟯


###### vitamin D

⟮Vitamin D⟯ deficiency is common worldwide, occurring in about a ⟮1 billion⟯ people, and is surprisingly common in ⟮europe⟯. 
⟮Vitamin D⟯ has many function, amongst the most important being ⟮increasing the absorption⟯ of ⟮minerals⟯ such as ⟮calcium, magnesium, and phosphate⟯ 
⟮Vitamin D⟯ ⟮deficiency⟯ can cause or excarbate a wide variety of conditions, many featuring ⟮bone⟯ or ⟮muscle⟯ ⟮weakness⟯, and some ⟮respiratiory infections⟯ as well as ⟮mental illnesses⟯ 
⟮Rickets⟯ is a condition that results in ⟮weak⟯ and ⟮soft⟯ ⟮bones⟯ in ⟮children⟯ 

⟮Vitamin D⟯ occurs only ⟮rarely⟯ in food, specifically in ⟮oily fish⟯ such as ⟮salmon/herring/mackerel⟯ as well as ⟮mushrooms⟯ (if these have been ⟮exposed to UVB ligh ≈ been in the sun⟯) 
While ⟮Vitamin D⟯ can be synthesized by contact with ⟮UVB⟯ rays from ⟮sunlight⟯, many people ⟮do not do this enough⟯, it is not necessarily possible in ⟮winter⟯, and may not be ⟮advisable⟯ due to ⟮skin cancer risk⟯ 
In the ⟮US⟯ and some other countries, ⟮milk⟯ and ⟮milk substitutes⟯ as well as ⟮breakfast cereals⟯ are fortified with ⟮Vitamin D⟯.

⟮Minerals⟯ are ⟮micronutrients⟯ that ⟮are inorganic chemical elements⟯ 

###### macro/trace/ultratrace

⟮Minerals⟯ as micronutrients are subcategorized (by ⟮amount necessary⟯) into ⟮macrominerals⟯, ⟮trace minerals⟯, and ⟮ultratrace minerals⟯. 
There are many ⟮ultratrace⟯ elements that have been ⟮suggested as essential⟯, such claims are ⟮difficult to reproduce⟯.

###### various minerals

####### calcium

⟮Calcium⟯ most famously exists in ⟮dairy⟯, but ⟮also in other things.⟯ 

####### iron

⟮Iron⟯ ⟮from food⟯ comes in two forms, ⟮heme⟯ ⟮iron⟯ which can only be gotten from ⟮animal flesh⟯, and ⟮non-heme⟯ ⟮iron⟯ which can also be gotten from ⟮other sources⟯ 
⟮Heme⟯ iron is ⟮better absorbed⟯ by the body than ⟮non-heme⟯ iron. 
Iron from ⟮non-heme⟯ sources is ⟮more readily absorbed⟯ if ⟮consumed with foods⟯ that contain either ⟮heme-bound iron⟯ or ⟮vitamin C⟯. 

####### iodine

⟮Iodine⟯ ⟮deficiency⟯ leads to many bad outcomes, many due to the fact that ⟮iodine⟯ is necessary to ⟮make one of the thyroid hormones (thyroxine⟯), lack of which leads to ⟮high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH⟯), causing ⟮the thyroid to swell⟯ 
in many countries, ⟮table salt⟯ is fortified with ⟮iodine⟯ in the form of ⟮iodine⟯ ⟮salts⟯, which has proved effective at preventing ⟮iodine⟯ ⟮deficiency⟯ 
In Deutschland kommen Iodverbindungen ⟮in den Böden⟯ unverändert ⟮in zu geringen Mengen vor⟯. Durch ⟮die Iodierung von Speisesalz⟯ ist ⟮der Iodmangel in Deutschland verringert worden⟯, dennoch besteht in Deutschland bei ⟮36⟯ % der Bevölkerung ein ⟮milder⟯ und bei ⟮21⟯ % ein ⟮moderater bis schwerer⟯ ⟮Iodmangel⟯. 

##### choline

Choline is a micronutrient that is neither a mineral nor a vitamin.
⟮Choline⟯ is available in what feels like ⟮just about any food⟯, but is genrally highest in ⟮animal products (meat/fish/dairy/eggs⟯), which is why it is sometimes said ⟮vegans should pay some attention to it⟯ (prob not necessary tho).

###### testicular self-examination

General medical advice is to self-examine ⟮one's testicles⟯ ⟮once a month⟯ to check for ⟮testicular cancer.⟯ 
When ⟮self-examining ones testicles,⟯ the two parts are to ⟮feel them once-over⟯ and to ⟮measure them⟯. 
When measuring your testicles, having ⟮one testicle be larger than the other⟯ is ⟮normal⟯, what you want to look out for is ⟮size changes diachronically⟯. 
When ⟮feeling your testicles⟯, you're feeling for ⟮lumps/bumps or similar⟯, representing ⟮possible tumors⟯. Generally, these are ⟮painless⟯, though ⟮a dull soreness⟯ in ⟮your whole testicles⟯ is also ⟮something to keep an eye out for⟯.

⟮appendicitis⟯ is ⟮inflammation of⟯ ⟮the appendix⟯ 
⟮The inflammation of the appendix that is appendicitis⟯ is often caused by ⟮a blockage of the appendix⟯. 
⟮The blockage of the appendix leading to appendicitis⟯ is most commonly due to ⟮a calcified 'stone' made of feces⟯. Due to this reason, ⟮a high-fiber diet⟯ reduces ⟮the long-term risk of appendicitis⟯.

There is ⟮c+;a cluster ofsigns＆symptoms⟯ associated with ⟮appendicitis⟯, but ⟮a fairly high percentage (40%⟯) ⟮do not present most/all of the typical symptoms⟯, and ⟮a smaller percentage⟯ may have ⟮their pain be located differently⟯, due to ⟮the appendix itself being in a different location⟯. 
The ⟮pain⟯ for ⟮appendicitis⟯ generally appears relatively ⟮suddenly⟯ ⟮near or above the belly button⟯, ⟮from where it then moves⟯ ⟮into the right lower belly⟯. 
The ⟮pain⟯ for ⟮appendicitis⟯ is usually ⟮strong⟯ and ⟮gets worse⟯ with ⟮(esp. jarring) movement⟯ (one can test for this by ⟮jumping up or down⟯). 
⟮The hamburger sign⟯ is used for ⟮assessing if the person has appendicitis⟯: the person ⟮is asked if they would like to eat their favorite food⟯: A ⟮positive hamburger sign⟯ is ⟮them declining the food⟯, with ⟮a sensitivity (true postive rate⟯) of ⟮80%⟯. 
One of the symptoms of ⟮appendicitis⟯ is ⟮stiff⟯ ⟮belly muscles⟯. Connected to this is ⟮rebound tenderness⟯: If you ⟮press on your belly for a while⟯, and then ⟮suddenly release⟯, the ⟮main pain⟯ will be ⟮on release (though the initial press will also hurt⟯) 
To determine the exisitence of ⟮appendicitis⟯ with certainty, ⟮CT/ultrasound⟯ is needed. 
If ⟮appendicitis is left untreated⟯, ⟮the appendix may burst⟯, causing ⟮the inflammation of the interior abdominal wall (peritonitis⟯). Once this has happened, there is ⟮a high risk of death⟯. 
⟮Appendicitis⟯ is also often accomodated by ⟮nausea⟯ and ⟮vomiting⟯.

##### thrombi

What we call ⟮a blood clot⟯ is more properly called ⟮thrombus⟯. 
⟮Thrombosis⟯ is the formation of ⟮a thrombus⟯ ⟮inside a blood vessel⟯ that ⟮obstructs the flow of blood⟯. 
If ⟮the thrombus then breaks free⟯, it becomes an ⟮embolus⟯. 
if ⟮a thrombus⟯, after ⟮breaking free and becoming an embolus⟯ ⟮get lodged again⟯, that is a form ⟮embolism⟯, specifically a ⟮s10;⟮thromboembolism⟯⟯. 
Based on where they occur, ⟮thromboses⟯ are classified into ⟮venous⟯ and ⟮arterial⟯. 

###### thromboses

⟮Thromboses⟯ most often occur in ⟮the veins⟯ of ⟮the legs⟯, other bodyparts are ⟮affected far more rarely⟯. 
If you have a ⟮thrombosis⟯, your limb, esp. your leg, will often become some of the following:  ⟮swollen::size⟯, ⟮turn red or blue::color⟯, ⟮have more visible veins::appearance of thing⟯, ⟮be shiny due to taut::surface appearance⟯, ⟮may feel more heavy::feeling⟯, ⟮be warmer::feeling⟯, and ⟮hurt quite severely, especially while stepping::pain⟯. 
⟮Thromboses⟯ are often caused by ⟮not moving that bodypart for a while⟯, e.g. ⟮because of an illness that prevents it⟯ 
If ⟮a thrombus blocks the blood vessel completely⟯, ⟮the surrounding tissue will start to die⟯.

##### emboli

An ⟮embolus⟯ is ⟮some kind of foreign object⟯ (amongst others: ⟮s1:2;⟮thrombi⟯, ⟮fat globules, gas bubbles, cholesterol plaque/crystals⟯⟯ ) that ⟮travels through the bloodstream⟯. 
If an ⟮embolus⟯ ⟮gets lodged⟯ and thus ⟮s6;⟮blocks a blood vessel⟯⟯, this is known as an ⟮embolism⟯. ⟮s6:8;If it's ⟮a thrombus⟯ that ⟮gets lodged⟯, it is known as a ⟮thromboembolism⟯.⟯ 

###### pulmonary embolism

The ⟮severity of the effects⟯ of ⟮an embolism⟯ vary based on ⟮location (in the body⟯). 
One of ⟮the most severe types⟯ of embolism is ⟮pulmonary embolism⟯, i.e. ⟮embolism in the lungs⟯. 
If ⟮a pulmonary embolism⟯ ⟮is caused by thrombosis⟯ (as is ⟮common⟯), it is known as ⟮a pulmonary thromboembolism⟯. 
On average, the risk of experiencing a ⟮pulmonary embolism⟯ is ⟮0.1% in one year⟯, the ⟮mortality⟯ is ⟮10%⟯. It ⟮gets more common⟯ with ⟮age⟯. 
⟮Pulmonary embolisms⟯ produce the symptoms of ⟮rapid⟯ ⟮breathing⟯ and ⟮heartrate⟯, ⟮general malaise/a light fever⟯, ⟮shortness of breath⟯, ⟮chest pain⟯, ⟮coughing blood⟯ and up to ⟮passing out.⟯

### violence

#### behavioral and structural

⟮Structural violence⟯ is ⟮the tangible harm⟯ done by ⟮social structures⟯. 
⟮behavioral violence⟯ is ⟮the tangible harm⟯ done ⟮by agents volitionally⟯ 
⟮Structural violence⟯ is contrasted with ⟮behavioral violence⟯. 
However, in a second analysis, we might argue that ⟮we can reduce behavioral violence to structural violence⟯, for example via the concepts of ⟮stochastic/scripted terrorism/violence⟯ 
⟮about 300k deaths in a year in the US are attributable to income inequality⟯ is an example of ⟮structural violence⟯ 
⟮"Over 20 years’ worth of studies show that people of color who arrive at a hospital while having a heart attack are significantly less likely to receive aspirin, beta-blocking drugs, clot-dissolving drugs, acute cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, or bypass surgery."⟯ is an example of ⟮structural violence⟯ 

##### stochastic violence

⟮Stochastic violence⟯ is the idea of ⟮spreading a violent message via mass communication⟯, which ⟮makes resulting acts of violence⟯ ⟮probable⟯, but ⟮the actual place and time of the occurrence are⟯ ⟮random⟯. 
⟮Stochastic violence⟯ used for ⟮terrorism⟯ is called ⟮stochastic terrorism⟯ 
By ⟮transforming⟯ ⟮lone wolves⟯ ⟮into⟯ ⟮instances of larger patterns of violent messages⟯, ⟮stochastic violence⟯ ⟮unmasks behavioural violence⟯ as ⟮structural violence⟯ (perhaps) 
⟮Scripted violence⟯ is where ⟮someone describes the kind of violence they want to be carried out⟯, and then ⟮leaves it up to the audience to carry out this violence⟯. It may be seen as an instace of ⟮attempted stochastic violence/terrorism⟯

### +/-

any ism describes a structural system fundamentally defined by the contrast between two states/attributes, real or supposed.
For any ism, one state gets accorded significantly more of a bunch of positive stuff (influence, value, care, visibility etc.) while the other state gets accorded less or the opposite of this positive stuff, hence I call these states the + and - identity respectively.
+ and - also get other traits attached to them, creating two characters/charicatures, which are also placed in a contrastive relationship, which I call +traits and -traits as well as +characters and -characters.
+ and - also have a set of traits that constitute ideals for +/-ists while also being naturalized, which is called hegemonic +/-ity.
+ and - also of course create two groups of people who are in a + and a - state respectively, which I will call +ists and -ists respectively.
the experience that people with +/- identities = +/- experiences
Ambiguity is generally not tolerated, + and - are meant to be disjoint and S+ ∩ S- = U.
The power structure that an -ism establishes is called an -archy.
The totality of benefits that accrue to +ists because of an ism is »priviledge«.

For some isms, there seem to some to be an actual natural basis for the categorization into + and -, for those there have been attempts to separate + and - identities from their supposed natural bases. For me, I assume + and - are entirely socially constructed, and thus my models of isms rely on the separation or dismissal of any natural basis.

#### being-seen

throughout discourse (in the wide focaultian sense), +ists as well as the +experience is prioritized, thus the visibility of -ists and their experience is reduced:

x-normativity normalizes the + identity, experience and being a +ist of the relevant ism.
x-centrism places the + experience at the center of concern in a wide variety of areas, such that the + experience becomes enmeshed in the fabric of the social and built world.
Often x-normativity gives rise to one or more υ-cultures.
The sanctions that -ists face are such that many hide their - identity (stealth ＆ passing), thus the visibility of the - identity is further reduced.

Lack of visibility of - experiences, - identities, and -ists constitutes »erasure«.

The various ways in which the + experiences is prioritized and - visibility is reduced leads to low understanding for the - experience.
The - experience being not well understood is strengthened by and leads to more covering.
the - experience being not well understood and the traits associated with the -often leads to victim-blaming in response to violence against -ists.

+ traits are seen as (morally/value) good, and - traits as (morally/value) bad
- traits are seen to contain the seeds of evil, leading to a number of tropes with this premise.
- traits being seen as bad encourages pick-me x to act in such a way, in turn strenthening the idea of - traits as bad.
Due to - identity and traits being seen as undesirable, people with a - identity should wish to have a + identity instead.
x hegemony is the hierarchy between hegemonic +istity and hegemonic -istity.
x-normativity often causes equality to be identified as everyone becoming more like hegemonic +istity.
Besides the violence that having a - identity incurs, a mismatch between actual traits and traits expected by hegemonic - ity can produce sanctions, but so can having actual traits expected by hegemonic - ity = the double bind.
Hyper -ity is the extreme pursuit of the hegemonic -ity corresponding with one's - identity.
A model minority is a (part of a) - identity some of whose traits are seen positively.
A model minority's positively-seen traits serve to naturalize their negatively seen traits.
A model minority's positively-seen traits serve to contrast with other subidentities of the - identity.

+ fragility is the state in which having ⟮the relevant ism privilege mentioned⟯, even ⟮in a minor way⟯, ⟮triggers a deep defensive response⟯. This reaction functions (on a societal level if not consciously) to ⟮maintain the current -ism order⟯

##### details

###### culture

υ culture, where υ is an aspect of the - experience is the pervasiveness and normalization of υ.
υ culture often gives rise to victim-blaming.

similarly but slightly differently, ⟮Car culture⟯ (when it doesn't just mean ⟮an appreciation for cars⟯) refers to ⟮a culture/environment/society which is designed for and around cars.⟯

###### passing ＆ stealth

In a broad sense, a person that is passing is assumed to be part of a social group that they are not in fact a part of.
In a narrow sense, passing is being percieved as part of a + group though one is actually part of a - group.
To go/be/live stealth is to hide that one is the -value state of an ism, and especially that one is trans.
To ⟮out⟯ someone is to ⟮reveal that a person⟯ is ⟮a -value person of an ism⟯, generally ⟮without their consent⟯

###### covering

Covering is downplaying one's - identity by hiding or downplaying parts of the - identity.
The requirement to cover is not so much to hide one's - identity to make it as unobtrusive to people with + identities as possible, or to give people with + identities the least amount of opportunity to attack / sanction one.

###### victim-blaming

Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them.

###### depiction in media/discourse

####### death

Though it is not true for every ism, in generally characters with - identities are more likely to die, or die first.

ism|TVtropes trope|details
racism|Black Dude Dies First|(despite name, any non-white character)
sexism|Vasquez Always Dies|(mostly transgressive, 'masculine' women, despite the fact these should be more apt to survive (A/N: Really though? Masculinity is associated with unnecessary risk-taking etc.))
hetero ＆ cissexism|Bury Your Gays, Gay Guy Dies First
sexism|Slashers Prefer Blondes ＆ Final Girl|The blonde girl 'tainted by sexuality' dies first, while the final girl, who is 'pure' survies until the end.
ablism|Bury Your Disabled

####### evil

Any - identity has certain characteristics that 'explain' how they could easily become evil, hence villains tend to have one or more - identity. 
hetero/cissexism, ablism and sanism seem to produce - identity as villains especially frequently.


Sexism|"Woman as temptress"
Heterosexism|"Depraved Homosexual",
"Psycho Lesbian",
"Depraved Bisexual"
Ableism|"Evil Cripple"
Cissexism ＆ Sexism|"Sissy Villain", 
"Makeup Is Evil", 
"Creepy Crossdresser"
Sanism|Crazy Villain
Allosexism|"Villainous Aromantic Asexual"


###### chasers

A ⟮chaser⟯ ⟮fetishizes⟯ and thus ⟮pursues⟯ ⟮the - group of an ism⟯.˛ 

###### pick me

A pick me x (girl/gay/whatever) is a - person who tries to distinguish themselves from other - people by separating themselves from traits associated with - by treating those traits negatively, in order to gain approval from + people.

###### medical and social models

Many ⟮isms⟯ have ⟮a medical model⟯ and ⟮a social model⟯ of ⟮what it is to be a -value person⟯. 
The ⟮ social model⟯ of ⟮being a -ist⟯ argues that ⟮society creates the - and + identities⟯ from ⟮the way it's structured/its inherent problems⟯
The social model places the genesis of a - identity in society, the medical model in the individual.
The ⟮medical model⟯ of ⟮being a -value person⟯ argues that being a -ist is a natural feature.
The medical model of being a -value person argues one ⟮should aim to⟯ ⟮move from -value to +value⟯ if possible, if not, one should ⟮focus on⟯ ⟮seeming +value⟯, and if that's not possible, one should ⟮be erased⟯ (often via ⟮special institutions⟯).
For isms with a medical model, the negativity associated with having a - identity is institutionalized and thus 'objectified'/naturalized in the medical field.
Neurodiversity is an attempt to reframe the distinction between + and - identities (sane and insane) within sanism as a value-neutral distinction between human mental traits.


medical model of|natural features that give rise to - identies|attempts to flip - identities to + identities are based on
sanism|brain chemistry|pharmacological treatment
cissexism|Gender identity disorder (until the DSM-5)/gebder dysphoria|hormone therapy, gender conforming surgery.

#### violence

-ists suffer varied forms of structural and behavioral violence.

##### economics

###### pay gap

The ⟮x pay gap⟯ or ⟮x wage gap⟯ is the ⟮difference between the remuneration⟯ ⟮for - group and + group of an ism⟯ for ⟮work⟯. 
There are two forms of ⟮x pay/wage gap⟯, ⟮non-adjusted⟯ and ⟮adjusted.⟯ 
The ⟮non-adjusted⟯ ⟮pay gap⟯ {{c11::just takes into account the difference in average pay} 
The ⟮adjusted⟯ ⟮pay gap⟯ ⟮adjusts for factors such as employee's age, education level, years of work experience, occupation, industry, location, company and job title⟯ 
The pay gap that it was coined for was the ⟮gender pay gap⟯, there is however also ⟮strong evidence for pay gaps for other - groups,⟯ such as ⟮the race pay⟯ gap. 
For ⟮intersectional identities⟯, ⟮pay gaps⟯ can be ⟮stark indeed⟯, for example, ⟮black women⟯ are payed ⟮63 cents⟯ and ⟮latina women⟯ just ⟮55 cents⟯ (both ⟮non-adjusted) ⟯ for ⟮each dollar a white man makes.⟯ 

###### ceiling

the x ceiling is the unofficial/uncodified/'invisible' limit on career advancement that people with a certain - identity face.
heterosexism|lavender ceiling
sexism|glass ceiling
racism (asian-american)|bamboo ceiling
nativisim (refugees)|canvas ceiling
classism|class ceiling

Importantly, the cotton ceiling is the exclusion of trans people from consideration as sexual partners, not anything to do with employment.

####### cliff

the ⟮x cliff⟯ is the idea that even if ⟮people with a - identity⟯) ⟮s4;s5;⟮break through the glass ceiling⟯⟯, they are often given ⟮executive positions⟯ during ⟮periods of crisis/downturn⟯, where ⟮s5; ⟮the risk of failure is highest⟯, e.g. ⟮s6;c7;Ellen Pao at reddit, Thresa May after brexit.⟯⟯ 

####### statistics

#### resistance

For any ism, the dominant position is that -ists should stay invisible and quiet, to allow for erasure.
Thus, hegemonic -ity always includes not aiming to upset the status quo.

#### consciousness

We might say political consciousness is seeing/recognizing the relevant ism as structuring the world (at least in part), coming to realize your part in a community of -ists, and thus understanding ⟮problems⟯ and ⟮remedies⟯ in ⟮terms of political action⟯
ergo: race-consciousness → political consciosuness regarding racism etc.
false consciousness is the failure to gain political consciousness or to gain the wrong sort of political consciousness.
false consciousness happens due to all the ways the relative ism distorts thinking and seeing.
Marxism argues that without false consciousness (at least in the case of capitalism), the -ists would overthrow the +ists.

##### origin: class consciousness

⟮class consciousness⟯ (in a sort of general sense) is ⟮political consciousness⟯ (in the sense of ⟮seeing one's experience and struggle as part of a group⟯) of ⟮social classes⟯, and since it's a ⟮marxist⟯ term, esp. of ⟮the proletariat⟯ and ⟮the capitalists⟯. ⟮Class consciousness⟯ is the ⟮original⟯ term, is ⟮more common⟯ than ⟮political consciousness⟯ as a term, and is thus also ⟮often used as a synonym.⟯

The kyriarchy is the -arch of multiple or all -archys at the same time.
within ⟮kyriarchy⟯ people may be ⟮both opressor and opressed⟯ at the same time or at different times. Originally but not always imagined as a ⟮pryramid⟯.

### intersectionality

⟮intersectionality⟯ considers ⟮social identities⟯ and concomittant ⟮oppression/domination⟯ and ⟮privilege⟯ in ⟮combination⟯, rather than ⟮considering each factor in isolation⟯. 
⟮Intersectionality⟯ was coined by ⟮Crenshaw⟯ in ⟮1989⟯ and started ⟮being popular as a framework⟯ in ⟮the early 2000s⟯ 
In 1989, Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term "⟮intersectionality⟯" in a paper as a way to help explain the ⟮oppression of African-American women⟯. She argues the experience of being a ⟮black woman⟯ ⟮cannot be understood⟯ in terms ⟮independent of either being black or a woman⟯. Rather, it must include ⟮interactions between the two identities⟯, which, she adds, frequently reinforce one another. 
⟮Tripple oppression⟯ is a term developed originally by ⟮black socialists in the US⟯, which refers to (in our modern terminolgy) ⟮the intersectional experience⟯ of ⟮black women⟯ at the nexus of ⟮classism, racism, and sexism⟯ 

### justification

Homonationalism is the phenomenon where some powers line up with the claims of the LGBT community in order to justify racist, nativist, etc. positions.

## specific isms

### racism

#### school to prison pipeline 

the ⟮school-to-prison pipeline⟯ in one definition is the ⟮disproportionate tendency⟯ of minors and young adults from ⟮disadvantaged backgrounds⟯ (generally ⟮race⟯-related) to ⟮become incarcerated⟯, often due to ⟮educational discrimination⟯. §
the ⟮school-to-prison pipeline⟯ may also reference the effects of ⟮a slew of policies⟯ to ⟮make school more 'tough on crime'/prison-like⟯. 
Often the ⟮school-to-prison pipeline⟯ refers to both ⟮the schools-as-prisons⟯ and ⟮the generally race-related educational discrimination⟯ that ⟮makes children more likely to end up in prison.⟯

### classism

A distinction of the ⟮poor⟯ that began with ⟮the poor laws in england in the 1600s⟯ (as far as I can tell) and we still have is that between the ⟮deserving⟯ ⟮poor⟯, generally characterized as ⟮somehow unable to work⟯ and thus ⟮not to be blamed⟯ for their ⟮poverty⟯, and ⟮undeserving⟯ ⟮poor⟯, which are characterized as ⟮those that could work but don't want to⟯ and thus ⟮are to be blamed⟯ for their ⟮poverty⟯

### (dis)ablism

#### inspiration porn

⟮Inspiration porn⟯ is the portrayal of ⟮people with disabilities⟯ as ⟮inspirational⟯ solely or in part on the basis ⟮of their disability⟯. We should probably consider it a form of ⟮(dis)ablism⟯.

### x work/x-al labor

⟮Hochschild⟯ coined the terms ⟮emotion work/emotional labor⟯. 
On ⟮the model of⟯ emotion work/emotional labor, other ⟮more or less common terms have been coined⟯. 
While ⟮some people⟯ treat ⟮emotion/x work and emotional/x-al labor⟯ as ⟮synonyms⟯, there is ⟮a clear distinction⟯. 

|value|example
⟮x work, e.g. emotion work⟯|⟮use value only⟯|⟮c+;s16:17;part of a job⟯
⟮x-al labor, e.g. emotional labor⟯|⟮use value and exchange value⟯|⟮c+;s19:20;in an intimate relationship⟯

The two strategies people use in performing ⟮emotion work/labor (not sure in how far it applies to the family of similar concepts⟯ are  ⟮surface acting and deep acting⟯ 
⟮emotion work/labor⟯ by ⟮getting into a state where one genuinely feels the emotions⟯ is called ⟮deep acting⟯ 
⟮emotion work/labor ⟯ by ⟮pretending, without changing how one actually feels⟯ is called ⟮surface acting⟯

### citation metrics

#### coupling ＆ co-citation

flex-container:✫Visualization_of_co-citation_analysis_methods.png✫

Bibliographic coupling measures how many of the same works two documents cite. 
If two documents cite at least one work in common, they are bibliographically coupled. 
The bibliographic coupling strength/index will be 3 if they cite 3 works in common.
Co-citation measures how frequently two documents are cited together by other documents. 
If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. 
The more co-citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength/index (e.g. co-cited by 3 works → co-citation strength of 3). It is supposed to predict how semantically-related they are.

## writing

### referencing

#### plagiarism

plagiarism is using someone else's intellectual/artistic products without proper attribution.

#### citation

##### content

Reference and citation are most often synonyms.
Citation is indicating a source of information.
A »full citation« fully identifies a source, and where in the source the information can be found, if applicable.
A »short citation« identifies a source in a short way and where in the source the information can be found, if applicable. to resolve a short citation to the actual work, finding the corresponding full citation is normally needed.
Philosophical works sometimes get an abbreviation such as KrV for use in short citations
A »complete citation« is the pair of a short citation and a full citation.
Author-date is a type of short citation where one includes the author and date.
Author-date citation is also called harvard style.

some citation styles allow using ibid. instead of the page information if the page information is repeated.

##### placement

onion-box:
citations 
  in-body citation 
    note citation
    in-text citation
  works cited/references entry


Note citations are citations in endnotes/footnotes.
In-text citations are citations within the flow of text.
Typically, short citations are also in-body citations, and full citations are reference entries.

##### → in-text short citations

Parenthetical citation is a type of in-text short citation format where the citation is surrounded in parentheses.
Narrative citation is a type of in-text short citation format where the citation is mentioned in the prose of the text.
Author-date/harvard style is often realized as narrative or parenthetical citations.
author-date-narrative-format ::= ‹author› \(‹date›\)
author-date-parenthetical-format ::= \(‹author› ‹date›[, ‹page-specifier›]\)

when adding page specifiers to author-date narrative citations, the page specifier goes in its own set of parentheses, at the end of the clause.

###### specifying pages

page-specifier ::= p. ‹integer›[f.|ff.|-‹integer›]

f.|this page or the next
ff.|this page or any following.

##### sections

＿Works Cited＿ and ＿References＿ are synonyms.
Sometimes the ＿References＿ section is also called 「reference list」
»Works Cited«/»References« are sections at the end of the work containing ＿full citations＿.
Properly, a »bibliography« should contain all works consulted, not those merely cited.
Often, 「bibliography」 is also just used as a synonym for ＿Works Cited＿/＿References＿.
A bibliography may also be a separate work listing works on a particular topic.
An annotated bibliography is a bibliography with author's comments on each work.
「Literaturverzeichnis」 is the german name for ＿Works Cited＿/＿References＿.
Quellenverzeichnis may be used as a synonym for Literaturverzeichnis, but is more properly a section used in historical science for identifying primary sources.

##### citation style

A citation style is a set of rules of how to structure your citations.
the APA is the american psychological association.
the APA publishes a style guide, which is often autohyponymously also called APA.
Of the APA style guide, the thing that is most well known is its citation style.
The current APA edition is the 7th, released 2019.

### fear

#### exposure therapy

flex-container:✫sm_2021-10-31--17-32-33-screenshot.jpg✫
A ⟮fear ladder⟯ is a technique within ⟮exposure therapy⟯. 
For any specific ⟮fear/anxiety/phobia⟯, a ⟮fear ladder⟯ consists of ⟮specific situations/steps⟯ and ⟮their associated fear ratings⟯ 
⟮Fear ratings⟯ for fears on ⟮the fear ladder⟯ generally are on ⟮a scale from 1 to 10⟯ 
There should roughly be ⟮one situation/action⟯ on the fear ladder for ⟮each fear rating from 1 to 10⟯. 
A ⟮fear ladder⟯ should be applied ⟮regularly⟯ (e.g. ⟮s16;⟮daily, a few times a week⟯⟯ ). 
⟮Each session of the application of a fear ladder⟯ should last until ⟮the thing feels less anxiety-provoking::desired outcome?⟯ ( ⟮s19;⟮half⟯ is a good goal to short for⟯ ) (often ⟮30min +::length⟯ are necessary, ⟮relaxation excersizes such as breathing⟯ can help) 
⟮c+;Fear ladders ＆ exposure therapy⟯ work(s) because ⟮your anxiety basically "runs out of gas"⟯. For ⟮a fear ladder⟯, start with ⟮the lower items⟯ on ⟮the fear ladder,⟯ and ⟮work yourself up to the higher items⟯ as they ⟮become less frightening⟯.

### dreams

#### REM sleep ＆ lucid dreaming

REM|Rapid Eye Movement
⟮Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep⟯ is the time where ⟮one dreams the weird kind of dreams we call dreams⟯. 
The body is mostly ⟮paralyzed⟯ during ⟮REM sleep⟯, except for ⟮the eyes⟯. 
The fact that ⟮eye movement can be controlled during REM sleep⟯ allows ⟮study participants to communicate with researchers⟯ during ⟮lucid dreaming.⟯ 

the time that ⟮⁑intentional⁑ behaviour takes⟯ in ⟮dreams⟯ is ⟮about the same⟯ as in ⟮RL⟯ 


##### Testing if one is dreaming

Activity|How to check?|Positive result if
⟮jumping⟯|⟮jump up⟯|⟮if you float or levitate⟯
⟮levitating⟯|⟮try and levitate⟯|⟮if it works⟯
⟮hands⟯|⟮check them⟯|⟮if you have extra fingers/nails/colors/etc.⟯
⟮clock⟯|⟮check it⟯|⟮if it shows an illogical time, or it changes rapidly⟯

⟮magical powers⟯|⟮try and use them⟯|⟮if it works⟯


A ⟮lucid dream⟯ is one in which ⟮one is aware that one is dreaming⟯. 
⟮Often but not always⟯, ⟮lucid dreams⟯ allow ⟮some control over the events happneing in the dream⟯. 
Evidence for ⟮lucid dreams existing⟯ is ⟮quite strong.⟯ 

### perception

The rashomon effect is where eyewitnesses give contradictory descriptions of an event.

## neurodiversity

### OCD

OCD|Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
⟮OCD⟯ (at least using current definitions and stats) affects ⟮about 2%⟯ of people at ⟮some point in their life.⟯ 
⟮The onset⟯ of ⟮OCD⟯ is most commonly ⟮in late adolescense/early 20s.⟯
In general, ⟮OCD⟯ mainly consists of ⟮obsessions⟯ and {{c-::compulsions}}
⟮Obsessions⟯ are ⟮intrusive = non-voluntary⟯, ⟮disturbing/uncomfortable/scary⟯ ⟮thoughts⟯. 
⟮Compulsions⟯ are ⟮the acts performed⟯ to ⟮soothe the obsessions⟯. 
People generally carry out their ⟮compulsions⟯ in a ⟮very structured⟯ manner. 
People suffering from OCD generally ⟮do not want to⟯ ⟮perform the compulsions⟯, ⟮but the discomfort of the compulsion and the need to get relief is often stronger⟯.
If acute, compulsions may take up ⟮a hour or more⟯ of the day.
OCD-like thoughts are ⟮common for everyone⟯, the question is ⟮the severity⟯. 
The ⟮most common type⟯ of ⟮OCD obsession⟯ is ⟮fears related to contamination (e.g. dirt, germs, viruses, chemicals⟯). 
Sometimes ⟮the obsession will become less important over time⟯, and ⟮the compusion will be carried out more as a habit⟯.

#### Strategy to get people to understand OCD

1. ⟮Ask relevant person to agree with a statement that saying something or thinking something doesn’t mean it will come true, that our thoughts are not magical and can’t make things happen⟯
2. ⟮c+;s1;Have them write down something terrible happen to a loved one⟯
3. ⟮c+;s∞;Have them notice the distress they feel at something that will not do anything⟯

## motivation

### learned helplessness

In aquiring ⟮learned helplessness⟯, agents are exposed to ⟮an averse stimulus⟯ that ⟮they cannot control/avoid⟯ ⟮repeatedly⟯ 
With ⟮learned helplessness⟯, agents fail to f⟮ail to avoid the thingy⟯ after ⟮being exposed to an unavoidable averse stimulus⟯, even when ⟮they have control again (and this is indicated clearly⟯) 
In fact, in contrast to the ⟮original idea of learned helplessness⟯, it seems that ⟮passivity is the default reaction⟯ and ⟮'helpfulness' is learned⟯ 
The ⟮original⟯ ⟮learned helplessness⟯ ⟮experiment⟯ featured ⟮shocking dogs⟯ ⟮without them being able to do anything about it.⟯ 
In ⟮the original learned helplessness experiment⟯, one needed to ⟮physically show the dogs (by moving their limbs⟯) ⟮how to escape the shocks⟯ ⟮at least twice⟯ so ⟮they would relearn that they had control⟯ 
The ⟮noise experiment⟯ is related to ⟮learned helplessness⟯ 
⟮c+;Hiroto, D.S.; Seligman, M.E.P.⟯ ⟮(c:37;1975⟯), subjects were supposed to ⟮do mental tasks⟯ while ⟮a distracting sound played⟯. ⟮hb;⟮One experimental group⟯ ⟮could (or thought they could) turn it off⟯, and ⟮the other⟯ ⟮couldn't⟯. ⟮hb;⟮The ones that could turn of the noise⟯ ⟮did better on the task⟯ ⟮even if they didn't turn it off.⟯⟯⟯ 
⟮Self-efficacy⟯ is ⟮(The strength of) one's belief⟯ in ⟮one's own ability⟯ to ⟮complete asks in order to reach a goal⟯ 
⟮Veritasium⟯ argues students/employees will ⟮try their best(based on what they know⟯) when ⟮given a task⟯, but ⟮if they hit a roadblock⟯, they ⟮won't try anything else (but just ask the supervisor⟯) - even though t⟮hey could have probably figured out methods to overcome a roadblock⟯ - reflecting, according to Veritasium, ⟮learned helplessness⟯ 
Veritasium argues besides the pracitcal reasons of connection and resources etc, ⟮self-efficacy⟯ is part of the reason ⟮children of people with a certain career take up that career.⟯ 

## relationships

### gaslighting

We get the term ⟮gaslighting⟯ from ⟮the 1940s film Gaslight⟯ 
In the film ⟮Gaslight⟯, the protagonist ⟮claims the gas lights were not dimmed⟯ after ⟮dimming them himself.⟯ 
⟮The protagonists goal⟯ in the film ⟮gaslight⟯ is ⟮to have his wife declared insane⟯. 
⟮Gaslighting⟯ is a form of ⟮manipulation⟯. 
The effect of (successful) ⟮gaslighting⟯ is that the victim ⟮can no longer determine⟯ /⟮is mislead about⟯ ⟮the trut⟯h, or that they ⟮can no longer tell⟯ ⟮right⟯ from ⟮wrong⟯, ⟮beneficial⟯ from ⟮harmful⟯. 
For example, someone ⟮gaslighting⟯ may deny that ⟮past events⟯ ⟮have happen⟯, and thus ⟮make the gaslit person question if they actually have⟯. 
For example, someone ⟮gaslighting⟯ may ⟮make fun of someones needs⟯, and thus ⟮make them question if their needs are actually legitimate⟯. 
⟮Gaslighting⟯ may be ⟮intentional⟯ or ⟮unintentional⟯, and may be more often used by ⟮narcissists / sociopaths⟯. 
⟮Gaslighting⟯ can occur in ⟮any personal relationship⟯, we may also want to ⟮extend the definition to a societal level⟯. 

### abuse

#### cycle of abuse

The ⟮cycle of abuse⟯ is a ⟮common pattern⟯ for ⟮abusive relationships⟯. 
The ⟮Cycle of abuse⟯: ⟮Tension building⟯ → ⟮Acute explosion/Incident⟯ → ⟮Honeymoon⟯ (repeat) 

### dark triad

#### narcissism

⟮»Narcissists«⟯ have an overriding desire to ⟮protect/soothe/strengthen⟯ their ⟮self-image.⟯ 
⟮»Narcisstic supply«⟯ are ⟮the doses of admiration, validation, approval, respect, attention, subservience⟯ that ⟮a narcisst seeks to soothe their self-image.⟯ 
»⟮Narcisstic injury⟯« is ⟮damage⟯ that a narcisst takes ⟮to their self-image.⟯ 

In ⟮a family with a narcissist⟯, people end up ⟮being forced into roles⟯ - ⟮the whole construct⟯ is called the »⟮narcissistic family⟯«. 
⟮The narcisstic family⟯'s ⟮roles⟯ are ⟮structural⟯: ⟮The relationships between roles is what creates the structure, and makes it resilient to change.⟯ 
⟮The narcissistic family⟯ consists of different ⟮roles⟯: ⟮the narcissist⟯, ⟮the golden child⟯ and ⟮the scapegoat⟯ ⟮establish the structure⟯, butressed by ⟮flying monkeys⟯, ⟮neutral siblings/people.⟯ and sometimes also others (e.g. enablers)
⟮Roles⟯ in a ⟮narcissistic family⟯ may ⟮shift⟯ if ⟮they do not provide the function to the narcissist anymore.⟯ 

In a narcissistic family the ⟮»golden child«⟯ is the person ⟮onto which the narcissist projects⟯ what ⟮they want to believe about themselves.⟯ 
The ⟮golden child⟯ ⟮strengthens the narcissists self-image⟯ by ⟮projection⟯. 
The ⟮golden child⟯'s ⟮achievements⟯ are ⟮highly rewarded⟯. 

In a narcissistic family, the »⟮scapegoat⟯« is the person ⟮onto which the narcissist projects⟯ what t⟮hey don't want to believe about themselves.⟯ 
The ⟮scapegoat⟯ ⟮strengthens the narcissists self-image⟯ by ⟮contrast⟯. 
The ⟮scapegoat⟯'s ⟮achievements⟯ are ⟮not acknowledged⟯, and may ⟮even surreptitiosuly be punished⟯. 
Conversely, the ⟮scapegoat⟯'s ⟮failures⟯ may be ⟮rewarded⟯. 
However, the scapegoat may have an easier time ⟮breaking away from the narcisstic family structure⟯. 

In a narcisstic family, the ⟮»neutral sibling/person«⟯ is said to be the sibling/person that ⟮always tries to mediate⟯, but ends up ⟮denying the reality of what's happening⟯. 
In a narcisstic family, a »⟮flying monkey⟯« is person ⟮used by the narcissist⟯ as ⟮a proxy for their narcissist actions.⟯ 

# lock-picking

## lockpicking tools

In general, the three major types of lockpicking tools are ⟮hooks⟯, ⟮rakes⟯, and ⟮tensioning tools⟯. 

## basic lock model

flex-container:✫sm_Simple-Paper-Lock-Lock-Picking-Theory.gif✫✫sm_Shear-Line-Lock-Picking-Theory.png✫
We can construct a basic sort of lock with ⟮a pencil⟯ and ⟮two pieces of paper.⟯ 
The ⟮gap between the two pieces of paper⟯ is ⟮the shear line⟯, and ⟮the pencil⟯ is ⟮the pin⟯. 

## lock externals

Everything else in a ⟮cylinder lock⟯ is ⟮contained in⟯ ⟮the cylinder(shell/casing/housing/body) ⟯ 
If we were to ⟮cut apart an average door in europe or the US⟯ and ⟮take the locking mechanism out⟯, we would be seeing ⟮the cylinder (shell/casing/housing/body⟯).

⟮The shoulder of a key⟯|⟮what prevents it from being inserted too far⟯|⟮✫sm_schlage-lock-diagram4.jpg✫⟯


The ⟮cylinder⟯ of a lock is also called ⟮shell/housing/casing/body⟯. 
⟮A lock that is contained in a cylinder⟯ is known as ⟮a cylinder lock⟯. 
⟮Cylinder locks⟯ are i⟮ndependent from the boltwork⟯, and so ⟮allow easy maintenance⟯. 
⟮Pin tumbler locks⟯ are the most common type of ⟮mechanism⟯ for ⟮cylinder locks⟯. 
⟮A pin tumbler lock⟯ uses ⟮pins⟯ ⟮contained in a tumbler⟯ to ⟮prevent locks from opening⟯. 
⟮Pin tumbler locks⟯ are the ones we think of when we think of ⟮locks and lock-picking⟯.

## comb picks

Some insecure locks allow us to unlock them by ⟮ pushing both key and driver pins ⟯ ⟮past the shear line⟯ 
⟮comb picks⟯ ⟮push⟯ ⟮both driver and key pins⟯ ⟮completely into the lock⟯ 
comb picks might look like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
What normally ⟮prevents us from just pushing all pins completely above the shear line w/ comb picks⟯ is ⟮that there isn't enough space in the lock⟯ 

## shear line

The ⟮shear line⟯ is ⟮the gap between⟯ ⟮the casing⟯ and ⟮the plug⟯ 
⟮the driver pins⟯ are the pins that ⟮the springs are directly contactin⟯g 
⟮the key pins⟯ are the pins that ⟮the key will directly contact⟯ and that ⟮thus 'read' the key⟯ 
To ⟮open a door⟯, ⟮the plug⟯ ⟮must be able to rotate⟯. 
If a door is ⟮locked⟯, ⟮the pins⟯ are ⟮preventing the plug from rotating⟯. 
For the ⟮plug to be able to rotate⟯, ⟮the gaps between pins⟯ must ⟮line up with the shear line.⟯ 
If ⟮the correct key is inserted⟯, it makes ⟮the gaps between pins⟯ ⟮line up with the shear line⟯. 
To ⟮prevent any old key to be used to open a lock⟯, ⟮the key pins have different lengths⟯ 
If you ⟮insert the wrong key into a lock⟯, the lock will not open because ⟮gaps between pins not in line with shear line⟯ 
The part of the lock that we are exploiting to pick is ⟮the shear line⟯ 
The thing that ⟮keeps the pins down in a lock⟯ are ⟮the springs⟯.

## manufacturing tolerances

In a general sense, locks would ⟮not be pickable⟯ if not for ⟮manufacturing tolerances⟯. 
The reason that ⟮not all pins bind⟯ once you ⟮apply rotational tension⟯ is tha⟮t the holes are ever-so-slightly off-center⟯. 
The pin that will ⟮bind here first⟯ if we ⟮rotate in the upwards direction⟯ is ⟮the second or the fourth pin.⟯ 

## binding pins

flex-container:✫sm_Setting-Standard-Pin-Lock-Picking-Theory-.gif✫✫sm_Lock-Picking-Single-Pin-Picking.gif✫✫sm_Peterson-GSP-Hook-1-Black-Handle.jpg✫
A ⟮bound⟯ pin is the one that if ⟮rotational tension is being applied⟯ is ⟮hard to move (won't slip⟯) 
⟮Applying rotational tension⟯ allows ⟮pins⟯ to ⟮bind⟯, and thus ⟮setting them⟯. 
Pins can only ⟮bind⟯ if ⟮rotational tension is being applied⟯, otherwise ⟮they won't get stuck⟯ and f⟮all right back into the cylinder.⟯ 
There is ⟮most often (though not always⟯) ⟮only one⟯ ⟮binding pin⟯ at a time. 
The ⟮binding pin⟯ is ⟮the pin⟯ that ⟮is currently being bound⟯ (or ⟮will be bound once rotational tension is applied⟯), and thus is ⟮the next pin that can be set.⟯

⟮Single pin picking⟯ is ⟮picking the pins one at a time⟯, which looks something like ⟮‹image above›⟯ 
⟮Single pin picking⟯ uses ⟮hooks⟯ as tools, which look something like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
Core loop of ⟮single pin picking⟯: ⟮find binding pin⟯ → ⟮set binding pin⟯ 
To ⟮test if⟯ ⟮sth is a binding pin⟯, you ⟮push it slightly⟯. 
Compared to ⟮non-binding pins⟯, if we push on ⟮the binding pin⟯, it will feel ⟮slightly stiffer and harder to lift⟯. 
T⟮o set the binding pin⟯, we ⟮push on the pin⟯ until ⟮we reach the shear line⟯. 
Once ⟮you've pushed the binding pin to the shear line⟯, if ⟮you've set the pin⟯, ⟮the driver pin will catch⟯ and t⟮he key pin will fall into the plug⟯. 
Once ⟮you've pushed the binding pin to the shear line⟯, if y⟮ou've set the pin⟯, you probably hear ⟮a slight click⟯ or feel ⟮a slight rotation⟯. 
However, it is also possible to
⟮push the binding pin in too far⟯|⟮overset⟯|⟮✫sm_overset_1130.jpg✫⟯
⟮not push the binding pin in far enough⟯|⟮underset⟯|⟮✫sm_underset_1130.jpg✫⟯

If you ⟮can no longer find a binding pin⟯, you have likely ⟮overset or underset a pin⟯ 

## tensioning

flex-container:✫sm_standard-tension-wrench.jpg✫


⟮tensioning tools⟯ are for ⟮applying tension to the lock (to bind the pins⟯) 
The ⟮tension wrench⟯ is ⟮the most common type of⟯ ⟮tensioning tool.⟯ 
A tension wrench might look like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
A ⟮tension wrench⟯ has ⟮a short end⟯ to ⟮place in the keyway⟯ and ⟮a long end⟯ to ⟮act as a lever⟯. 
You need to apply ⟮very little tension⟯ with ⟮the tension wrench⟯ to bind the pins. 
⟮Letting go of the tension applied with the tension wrench⟯ ⟮resets the lock⟯. 

## raking

flex-container:✫sm_Lock-Picking-With-A-Bogota-Rake-2.gif✫✫sm_Peterson-GSP-Bogie-2-Black-Handle.jpg✫


⟮Raking⟯ is ⟮scrubbing the pins⟯ until we ⟮happen to set all the pins⟯. 
Raking might look like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
⟮Raking⟯ has roughly the same motion as ⟮brushing your teeth⟯. 
In raking, we ⟮add tension⟯ and then ⟮scrub the pins⟯. 
In raking, while ⟮scrubbing the pins⟯, ⟮vary⟯ things like ⟮speed, tension, angle, height, etc⟯ ⟮slightly⟯. 
In raking, we ⟮reset the lock⟯ by ⟮removing tension.⟯ 
In ⟮raking⟯, we often have to ⟮reset the lock a few times⟯ before it works 
⟮Raking⟯ has the main advantage of ⟮being fast (to open the lock⟯), but the disadvantage of ⟮not working well for more difficult locks⟯. 
⟮Raking⟯ uses ⟮rakes⟯ as tools, which look like ⟮‹image›⟯
