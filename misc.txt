#### goods

##### commodities

Commodity is a term with three competing definitions:
name|field|definition|examples
⟮commodity⟯|⟮economics⟯|⟮good with full/high degree of fungibility⟯|⟮c+;s∞;wheat, petroleum, copper, rice, but not handmade bracelets⟯
⟮commodity⟯|⟮marxism⟯|⟮something with both use and exchange value⟯
⟮commodity⟯|⟮casual usage⟯|⟮any kind of market good⟯

From these definitions, ⟮commodification/commoditization⟯ may refer to ⟮any of the three definitions of commodity (economics, marxism, casual usage⟯)

##### fungibility

If a good is ⟮fungible⟯, it is ⟮readily interchanged with others of its kind⟯ without ⟮that making much of a difference⟯.
⟮Money, natural resources of the same grade, stocks of the same company⟯ all are examples for things with a high degree of ⟮fungibility⟯.

##### distribution

###### positional goods

a ⟮positional good⟯ is a good that is ⟮only valued⟯ by ⟮how it is distributed in a population⟯.
⟮Positional good⟯ is a term similar to ⟮status symbol.⟯
  ⟮Conspicuous comsumption⟯ is consumption to ⟮enhance social status/prestige⟯, that is, consumption ⟮of goods⟯ as ⟮positional goods⟯

##### durability

A ⟮durable⟯ or ⟮hard⟯ good is a good that ⟮does not quickly wear out or, more specifically, one that yields utility over time rather than being completely consumed in one use⟯ (Examples: ⟮c+;s3;a bicycle, washing machine, or ring⟯ ).
A ⟮non-durable⟯ or ⟮soft⟯ good is either defined as ⟮a good that is either consumed in one use⟯ (Examples: ⟮c+;s7;food, drinks, tissues⟯ ) or ⟮a good that has a lifespan of less than three years⟯ (Examples: ⟮c+;s9;cosmetics, medication, clothing⟯).

##### excludability and rivalrousness

###### excludability

A good that is ⟮excludable⟯ ⟮can have its use limited to certain people⟯. Examples: ⟮c+;s2;cinemas, food⟯
examples for ⟮non-excludable⟯ goods: ⟮air, public roads⟯.
As argued by ⟮Ostrom⟯, in fact excludability is a ⟮scale⟯ ⟮from being able to fully limit people from its use to not at all.⟯

###### rivalrousness

A good is ⟮rival(rous⟯) if ⟮consumption by one party prevents consumption by another⟯
Examples for ⟮rivalrous goods⟯ include ⟮an item of food, a hammer, a domain name⟯.
A good is ⟮non-rival(rous⟯) if ⟮consumption by another induces no additional cost⟯
Examples for ⟮non-rivalrous goods⟯ ⟮a television broadcast, a scenic view, clean air⟯.
A good is ⟮anti-rival(rous⟯) if ⟮consumption by another provides benefits to other consumers⟯, generally via ⟮network effects⟯.
Examples of ⟮anti-rivalrous good⟯s include ⟮FOSS software, social media, a specific language⟯
We may want to define ⟮a scale⟯ ⟮from rival(rous) through non-rival(rous) to anti-rival(rous⟯).

A ⟮network effect⟯ is when ⟮the value of a good/service increases with the amount of users⟯. Examples: ⟮Social networks, the phone or the internet⟯.
The precise value of a ⟮network effect⟯ is often stated in terms of ⟮Metcalfe's law⟯: ⟮value of network⟯ = ⟮(amount of users)⎴2⎴⟯. This law has since recieved some ⟮empirical validation⟯ for e.g. ⟮facebook, bitcoin⟯

###### goods with properties

|⟮excludable⟯|⟮non-excludable⟯
⟮rivalrous⟯|c1;s1:4;private good⟯|⟮c+;s1:4;common(-pool) good⟯
⟮non-rivalrous⟯|⟮c+;s1:4;club/toll good⟯|⟮c+;s1:4;public good⟯

####### common pool resources

A ⟮common-pool resource⟯ is a good that is ⟮non-excludable⟯ and ⟮rivalrous⟯, e.g. ⟮pasture⟯.
A ⟮common-pool resource⟯ may be subject to ⟮the tragedy of the commons⟯ (however, not necessarily)
In ⟮the tragedy of the commons⟯, ⟮any individual⟯ has ⟮an incentive to⟯ {{c8::(over)exploit the resource}.
In ⟮the tragedy of the commons⟯, ⟮the resource is depleted⟯ due the overexploitation.
As proven by ⟮Elinor Ostrom⟯ in the work that won her ⟮the 2009 economics nobel prize⟯, ⟮commons/common-pool resources⟯ can ⟮effectively be managed by their communities⟯ if ⟮certain rules/principles are followed⟯, preventing ⟮the tragedy of the commons⟯

####### public goods

A good that is ⟮non-excludable⟯ (= ⟮use cannot be prevented⟯) and ⟮non-rival(rous⟯) (= ⟮use does not reduce availability⟯) is a ⟮public good⟯.
Examples of ⟮public goods⟯ are ⟮National security, lighthouses, knowledge⟯
⟮public goods⟯ are subject to the ⟮free rider⟯ problems, where ⟮free riders⟯ ⟮(c:6;people who use the good but don't contribute to it⟯) result in ⟮the good being under-produced or overused and degraded⟯.
Examples of public goods ⟮subject to free rider problems⟯: ⟮Herd immunity, grades of group-graded projects⟯
A ⟮free rider⟯ is someone who ⟮recieves a benefit⟯ ⟮without contributing adequately to its cost of production⟯.

####### excludable goods

A ⟮club good⟯ is a good that is ⟮excludable⟯ and ⟮non-rivalrous⟯, e.g. ⟮toll roads⟯

⟮Econs⟯ are contrasted with (actual) ⟮humans⟯

##### nudge theory

Nudge theory proposes using nudges to influence the decision-making of groups or individuals to increase compliance with a goal.

A fly at the bottom of an urinal to improve aim and reduce cleaning costs is a prime example of a nudge.

##### bias

⟮Bias⟯ is the ⟮inclination toward⟯ or ⟮weighting of⟯ something, most often in a way that is ⟮unfair⟯ and/or ⟮disproportionate/wrong⟯. Thus, ⟮s1:3;⟮s7:12;⟮cognitive bias⟯ is ⟮the disproportionate weighting⟯ / ⟮irrelevant inclusion⟯ of factors in a way that ⟮the resulting judgement departs from rationality⟯⟯; ⟮s4-6,10-12;bias in ⟮statistics⟯ is the tendency of ⟮a statistic, more specifically an estimator (a truth about a sample⟯) to ⟮misestimate⟯ a ⟮parameter (a truth about the population) ⟯⟯;⟮s4:9; ⟮implicit bias⟯ are ⟮pre-reflective (or impossible-to-reflect-away) attitudes⟯ about ⟮a social group⟯⟯⟯

####### mean world syndrome

Mean world syndrome is a hypothesized cognitive bias wherein people (especially those not particularly in danger of violence) may perceive the world to be more dangerous than it actually is, due to long-term moderate to heavy exposure to violence-related content on mass media.

####### decoy effect

An option C is asymmetrical dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option A and a mix of inferior and superior to another option B.
In the decoy effect, there are three options A, B, and C, where C is assymerically dominated.
In the decoy effect, the decoy is the one that is asymetrically dominated.
In the decoy effect, people will choose the dominating option A more than if the decoy C was not present.

###### statistical bias

####### selection bias

######## WEIRD

⟮WEIRD⟯ is short for ⟮western⟯, ⟮educated⟯, ⟮industrialized⟯, ⟮rich⟯, and ⟮democratic⟯.

##### religious markets

⟮the idea of religious markets⟯ involves seeing religions ⟮through the lens/metaphor of a capitalist market⟯, most commonly one based on ⟮rational choice theory.⟯ ⟮hb;Thus, ⟮the market goods⟯ would be ⟮religions⟯, which would ⟮compete⟯ in such an environment.⟯ 
Analogous to the idea of ⟮religious markets⟯ ( = ⟮c+;s2,9;seing competition of religions through the metaphor of a market⟯ ) there is ⟮hb;the idea of the ⟮dating market⟯ ( = ⟮c+;s9;seeing competition between dating partners through the metaphor of a market) ⟯⟯

⟮revanchism⟯ is like ⟮irredentism⟯, but generally the territory claimed ⟮was once actually held⟯, with less emphasis on ⟮whether that territory is ethnically/'properly' part of the nation⟯ 


France ⟮claiming alsace-lorraine/wanting it back⟯ was both a ⟮irredentist⟯ and a ⟮revanchist⟯ claim. 
An ⟮irredentist⟯ claim is often expressed as a claim for ⟮Greater X (Greater Serbia etc.⟯)

In American politics, the ⟮Southern strategy⟯ was a ⟮Republican Party⟯ electoral strategy to increase political support ⟮among white voters in the South⟯ by ⟮appealing to racism against African Americans⟯ starting during (and exploiting the fears created by⟮ the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s⟯), causing the ⟮s2;Republican party⟯ to end up ⟮far further to the right and in roughly the same position as it has today⟯. Politicians most associated with this are ⟮Richard Nixon⟯ and ⟮Barry Goldwater.⟯ 

⟮Lee Atwater⟯ has a famous ⟮quote⟯ in which he describes the evolution of ⟮republican::whose?⟯ messaging in the context of the ⟮southern strategy⟯ from ⟮"Nigger"⟯ to ⟮dog-whistles⟯ such as ⟮forced busing⟯ and ⟮state's rights⟯ to ⟮supposedly economic issues⟯ such as ⟮cutting taxes⟯ that ⟮"just happen" to hurt black people more⟯. 
⟮Lee Atwater'⟯s famous quote is often understood as ⟮the intentional perfidiousness of hiding racism in structural violence not mentioning race⟯, but he actually believed that ⟮this would end up making race less important⟯. 

＞ You start out in 1954 by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger." By 1968, you can't say "nigger" – that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now, you're talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me – because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."

⟮Harlequin Enterprises⟯ is a company that ⟮publishes romance novels⟯, and reached a peak market domination (in NA) of ⟮80-90%⟯ of sales in ⟮the 1990s⟯. As of 2002, they publish about a ⟮1k books⟯ a year.
⟮Harlequin⟯ sets ⟮precise standards⟯ for their romance novels, with ⟮restrictive contracts⟯ with ⟮bad pay⟯ and ⟮precise page counts⟯. 
⟮Harlequin⟯ features different ⟮series⟯ with different ⟮themes⟯, which also vary things such as ⟮sexual content⟯. 
Harlequin series include 『⟮Love Inspired⟯』 ⟮(c:15;Christian romances where faith is featured as prominently as passion⟯) and 『⟮Harlequin Presents⟯』 ("a⟮lpha males, decadent glamour and jet-set lifestyles⟯")

＞ Japanese romances rarely have covers that depict the principal characters, and the text descriptions are by no means as detailed as in the Harlequin-style texts. Clothing is not, in my corpus, ever used as a tool of seduction, and no lovers’ furtive glances at escaping chest hair or heaving breasts or quick but intoxicating looks at glimpses of beautiful long legs through the slits of skirts help our Japanese lovers know that they have found Ms. or Mr. Right

#### characteristics of a third place according to theorists

At least for regulars, third places are not particularly restricted in access, and people have little to no obligation to be there.
Third places must feel warm, accomodating and accepting of different people, with little distinction and snobbery.
Third places have a certain set of regulars, though those are not necessarily the only people in the space.

One of the ⟮first things⟯ to do if ⟮you find out that a disaster will hit⟯ is ⟮find out if you should evacuate⟯. 
Many countries will have predefined ⟮evacuation routes⟯ for evacuation, which you ⟮should follow if possible⟯ 
In the US at least, for storms such as hurricanes there are ⟮voluntary⟯ and ⟮mandatory⟯ ⟮evacuation orders⟯. 
In response to an ⟮emergency⟯, ideally ⟮stay up to date⟯ on ⟮current goverment information⟯ 
If you ⟮evacuate⟯, make sure you take ⟮c+;the necessary supplies ⟯ 
If you decide to ⟮evacuate⟯ in response to an emergency, inform ⟮friends and family⟯ ⟮where you're going⟯ 
If you are subject to a severe storm/etc. and are staying home, ⟮fill up your bathtub with water⟯. It's not for ⟮drinking⟯, it's for ⟮flushing the toilet etc⟯. 
If you are subject to a severe storm/etc. and are staying home, perhaps the most important thing is to have ⟮water⟯ and ⟮non-perishable food⟯. 
Depending on the type of disaster and the government response, ⟮evacuation⟯ may be ⟮to predefined shelters⟯, but you also may be ⟮required or forced to find your own accomodation⟯ 
In general, in preparation for a storm, have at least ⟮3 l * 3 days⟯ of ⟮water⟯ per ⟮person⟯, ideally ⟮more⟯, plus ⟮some for washing hands etc.⟯ 
If you are staying home before a disaster hits, ⟮turn your fridge and freezer⟯ to ⟮the coldest setting⟯. Once ⟮the disaster hits⟯, ⟮keep them closed as much as possible⟯. This is to ⟮preserve the food as long as possible⟯. 
If you are in the path of a storm, ⟮fill up your gas tanks⟯, should you have a ⟮car⟯, so ⟮you can evacuate if necessary⟯. 
After  a longer power outage, your ⟮food⟯ might be ⟮spoiled⟯. 
After a major catastrope you may ⟮be full of adrenaline⟯, so you might not ⟮notice huge injuries⟯ without ⟮checking yourself⟯. 

#### storms

##### hurricanes

If a hurricane or similar is ⟮going to hit your property⟯, to prevent damage ⟮remove⟯ or ⟮tie down⟯ ⟮anything that isn't niet und nagelfest⟯ 
If a hurricane or similar is ⟮going to hit your property⟯, ⟮board up/protect⟯ ⟮your windows and doors⟯ 
After a hurricane, Do not use ⟮phones⟯ exept for ⟮emergency services.⟯ (to keep the phone lines free) 
After a hurricane or flood, the ⟮tap water⟯ might be ⟮contaminated⟯. 

## human geography

### heterotopia

⟮Heterotopia⟯ are ⟮similar to⟯ ⟮normal space⟯ in that they ⟮occupy space⟯, however they are ⟮different from⟯ ⟮normal space⟯ in a number of ways. 
In a very general sense, in ⟮heterotopia⟯ ⟮normal space⟯ is simultaneusly ⟮represented⟯, ⟮contested⟯ and ⟮inverted⟯ 
⟮Heterotopia⟯ often (related to their epistemic relation to real space) either ⟮create a space of illusory order⟯, or ⟮expose real space by contrast⟯ 
⟮Heterotopia⟯ are  often ⟮not accessible the way normal space is accessible⟯, they  either ⟮compell entrance (prisons etc.⟯) or ⟮require rituals/purification to enter⟯ ⟮Heterotopia⟯ have ⟮a function relative to society,⟯ amongst others ⟮heterotopia of crisis⟯ and  ⟮heterotopia of deviation⟯ 
Examples of ⟮heterotopia of crisis⟯ are ⟮boarding schools, honeymoon trips (for loss of virginity⟯) 
Examples of ⟮heterotopia of deviation⟯ are ⟮prisons, rest homes, psychiatric hospitals⟯ 
In modern society, ⟮heterotopia of crisis⟯ have the tendency to ⟮be replaced by heterotopia of deviation⟯ 
⟮Heterotopia⟯ have a close relationship with  the ⟮sacred (in a wide sense⟯) 
⟮Heterotopia⟯ often ⟮gather many different places in a single place⟯ (e.g.. gardens) ⟮Heterotopia⟯ often (related to time) correlate with ⟮heterochronia⟯, in that they either ⟮create a sort of achronia⟯ (e.g. ⟮museums⟯) or ⟮emphasize time in its most transitory⟯ (e.g. ⟮festivals⟯) 
All cultures have heterotopia, but ⟮the same heterotopia⟯ can have ⟮different functions⟯ ⟮in the same society at different times⟯, or ⟮in different societies⟯ 

### political geography

#### military geography

The ⟮chinese⟯ efforts to ⟮establish a series of friendly ports owned or beholden to them⟯ is called ⟮the String of Pearls initiative⟯ 
Some analysts have  alleged chinas true aims for ⟮the string of pearls initiative⟯ are ⟮Military bases⟯ 
China most often ⟮gains control of the ports⟯ for ⟮the string of pearls initiative⟯ ⟮via loans and the ports as collateral, which they collect when the goverments default⟯ 

#### nations ＆ states

In general, for ⟮a state to be a state,⟯ it must be r⟮ecognized by other states⟯. 
The common heuristic for ⟮something to be a state⟯ is ⟮if it is a member of the UN⟯. 
Currently there are ⟮193⟯ UN member states. 

##### capital cities

###### isolation and governance

According to Campante et al. 2013, in ⟮authoritarian⟯ states ⟮capital cities⟯ being ⟮isolated⟯ correlates with ⟮worse quality of governance⟯ = ⟮more resource extraction (of the ruling elite from the country⟯). 
Campante et al. 2013 argue the relationship ⟮c+;capital cities being more isolated → worse quality of government⟯ is ⟮causal⟯, based on a more ⟮isolated⟯ ⟮capital city⟯ being ⟮less succeptible to revolution⟯.

## theories ＆ approaches

### historical progress ＆ value

#### relativisim ＆ determinism

⟮Historical relativism⟯ is the idea that ⟮a period of / event in history⟯ can only be ⟮understood in its own terms⟯. 
⟮Historical determinism⟯ is the idea that ⟮history is determined in some way, e.g. by rules⟯. 
⟮Historism⟯ and ⟮historicism⟯ may refer to ⟮historical relativism⟯, ⟮historical determinism⟯, an idea where ⟮history should be priviledged as a cause⟯ for ⟮society⟯, ⟮culture⟯, or t⟮he explanation of phenomena⟯. Thus ⟮these terms are confused to the point of unusability.⟯ 

#### presentism

In history, ⟮presentism⟯ is the ⟮judgement/interpretation⟯ of the ⟮past⟯ in terms of ⟮current⟯ ⟮values⟯ and ⟮concepts⟯ 

#### combination

##### historical determinism

⟮Whig history⟯ at its most narrow sees ⟮british history⟯ as the ⟮inevitable⟯ ⟮progress⟯ from ⟮dark and despotic arbitrary tyranny⟯ to ⟮enlightened british liberal democracy⟯. 
⟮Whig history⟯ inbetween the most narrow and the most wide definitions sees ⟮history⟯ as the ⟮inevitable⟯ ⟮progress⟯ from ⟮a dark and terrible past of unfreedom⟯ to ⟮a glorious present of freedom and democracy⟯. 
⟮Whig history⟯ at its most broad sees ⟮history⟯ as ⟮the inevitable march of progress (where progress depends on the context it is used in, the author, etc.⟯). 



### historiography

⟮Historiography⟯ is the study of ⟮the way we write (and have written) history.⟯ 
The ⟮historiography⟯ of a specific thing is ⟮how history has studied/seen a specific thing⟯ 

#### black legend

a ⟮black legend⟯ is a ⟮historiographical⟯ phenomenon where ⟮an overly negative portrayal of something⟯ is created, often through ⟮biased writing⟯ 


### scales

#### microhistory

⟮Microhistory⟯ is a genre of history that ⟮focuses on small units of research⟯ 
Charles Joyner defines the questions ⟮microhistory⟯ asks as ⟮Ask large questions in small places⟯ 
The things ⟮microhistory⟯ might focus on are things such as ⟮an event, community, individual (esp. an unimportant one⟯) 
The ⟮most famous work of microhistory⟯ is  ⟮The cheese and the worms⟯ by ⟮Carlo Ginzburg⟯ 

#### macrohistory

⟮macrohistory⟯ is the approach to history ⟮looking for large, long-term trends⟯ in world history 

#### annales-school

The terms ⟮longue durée, moyenne durée and événement⟯ for scales of analysing history by ⟮the annales-school⟯ were formulated in their current form in ⟮the 1950s⟯ by  ⟮⦗Fernand⦘ Braudel⟯ 
The three levels of history that ⟮the annales-school and fernand braudel⟯ distinguish are the ⟮longue durée⟯, ⟮moyenne durée⟯ and the ⟮événement⟯. 
The annales school favored ⟮the longue duree⟯ as a level of analysis 
Name|Timespan|Examples|Other names|Similar concepts
⟮c1,5-7;longue durée⟯|⟮c+;s3:7;hundreds or thousands of years⟯|⟮c+;s2:7;Changes in climatology or physical geography⟯||⟮c+;s2:7;Macrohistory⟯

⟮Mary Wolstonecraft⟯, ⟮frustrated⟯ by the ⟮lack of opportunities⟯ for ⟮educated women⟯ and after working ⟮on-and-off⟯ as a ⟮governess⟯, ⟮caring for⟯ ⟮a dying friend⟯ and ⟮her dying mother⟯, and ⟮(c:10;unsuccessfully⟯ due to circumstances) ⟮founding a school⟯, began ⟮writing⟯, ⟮assisted by⟯ a ⟮liberal publisher⟯, and also ⟮fell into his croud of political thinkers⟯. 
⟮Wollstonecraft⟯ was ⟮catapulted to fame⟯ after writing her ⟮Vindication of the Rights of Men⟯ contra ⟮Burke⟯ in ⟮the Revolution Controversy,⟯ and ⟮travelled to France during the Revolution⟯ soon after.

⟮Wollstonecraft⟯ argued contra Burke that ⟮Marie Antoinette⟯ was not ⟮a noble victim⟯ but a ⟮femme fatale⟯, which was inevitable for one because MAs only function was ⟮to produce sons⟯, which ⟮corrupted⟯ her by ⟮reducing her only to a womb⟯, and also that ⟮queens (consort⟯) ⟮needed to be manipulative⟯, since ⟮the only way they could exercise influence⟯ was ⟮via their husbands or sons⟯

### slavery

#### soujorner truth

⟮Soujorner Truth⟯ was a ⟮former slave⟯ who became an ⟮abolitionist⟯ and ⟮women's right activist⟯ esp. ⟮from the 1840s onwards::time⟯ 
"⟮Ain't I a Woman⟯" mainly reflects on the theme of ⟮her being equal to men in any concievable way⟯, especially as regards ⟮physical endowments⟯ and ⟮the position in women in scripture⟯ (perhaps even ⟮more than equal⟯) 

The original version of "⟮Ain't I a Woman⟯" was published a ⟮few weeks⟯ after the speech and is probably ⟮relatively close to the original⟯, amongst other things because it doesn't suffer from ⟮imputing a southern accent to soujourner truth⟯, but was published in ⟮an anti-slavery magazine⟯ and thus ⟮had its own audience to consider⟯ 
The more commonly known version of Soujourner Truths speech "⟮Ain't I a woman⟯" was probably ⟮significantly changed⟯ by ⟮an abolition activist⟯ ⟮12 years⟯ later. It ⟮kept most of the substance⟯, but ⟮invented⟯ ⟮hostility from the audience:: attitude⟯, and ⟮embellished⟯ ⟮some details⟯ 
the most common version of the famous speech "⟮Ain't I a woman⟯" has the problem that ⟮Soujourner Truth⟯ would not have ⟮spoken in a southern dialect (having grown up in new york as a native dutch speaker⟯), that the ⟮original transcript did not include the phrase "Ain't I a woman",⟯ and that ⟮the speech was originally not titled at all⟯ 
  
 The most famous passage of the probably false rendition of "⟮Ain't I a woman⟯":  
⟮That man over there⟯ ⟮says that women need to be⟯ ⟮helped into carriages⟯, ⟮and lifted over ditches⟯, ⟮and to have the best place everywhere⟯. ⟮Nobody ever⟯ ⟮helps me into carriages⟯, ⟮or over mud-puddles⟯, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman?

## structuralism

CLS studied myth from the perspective of structuralism.
⟮CLS⟯ elaborated his ⟮structuralist⟯ approach to myth in  『⟮The Structural Study of Myth⟯』 ⟮(c:4;1955⟯) 
The ⟮paradox of myth according⟯ to CLS is that ⟮anything can happen in a myth⟯, but that ⟮myths are similar across cultures⟯. 
According to CLS, ⟮myth⟯ is its own form of ⟮langue⟯, that is, its own ⟮structuralist system⟯ 
The ⟮langue⟯ of ⟮myth⟯ consists of ⟮mythemes⟯ . 
According to CLS, myths consist of ⟮pairs of⟯ ⟮mythemes⟯, generally ⟮one⟯ ⟮c+;s15;pair⟯ that is ⟮contradictiory/irreconcilable⟯, and ⟮one⟯ ⟮c+;s15;pair⟯ that is ⟮reconcilable⟯. 
The ⟮contradictory pair⟯ of mythemes ⟮is equated with⟯ ⟮the reconcilable pair,⟯ and so ⟮the contradiction is dissolved/solved⟯, e.g. ⟮life:death⟯ ⟮↔⟯ ⟮herbivore:hunter⟯ (which is ⟮reconcilable⟯ via the ⟮scavenger⟯); ⟮life:death⟯ ⟮↔⟯ ⟮sky:earth⟯ (which is ⟮reconcilable⟯ via ⟮mist⟯) 

Both ⟮mythical thought⟯ and ⟮science⟯ are ⟮equally⟯ ⟮sophisticated⟯ ⟮systems of thought⟯ according to ⟮CLS⟯, however, ⟮science⟯ is ⟮more effective at⟯ ⟮acquiring knowledge to harness the world⟯. 

Type of thought|Causality|Metaphor|Materials (physical)|Materials (thought)|Creates
⟮Mythical thought⟯|⟮Hypercausal (Everything must have a definite cause⟯)|⟮Bricolage⟯|⟮uses whatever is at hand⟯|⟮uses signs (which are limited⟯)|⟮creates structures⟯
⟮Scientific thought⟯|⟮Causal, but can accept uncertainty⟯|⟮Engineer⟯|⟮uses (within limit) the things it needs as materials⟯|⟮uses concepts (which can go beyond preexisting ideas⟯)|⟮creates changes in the world⟯


The fact that ⟮a granary killing a person⟯ is ⟮not explained by chance + granary being unstable⟯ but by ⟮witchcraft + granary being unstable⟯ is for CLS an example of ⟮the hyperneed for causality⟯ in ⟮mythical thought⟯ 
According to ⟮CLS⟯, in ⟮mythical thought⟯ ⟮intellectual drive⟯ leads to ⟮more categorization/discovery⟯, and ⟮need for causality⟯ makes these '⟮do something⟯'

### birth rate/fertility

The ⟮different fertility rates are⟯ sometimes presented ⟮as-is⟯ (as ⟮a percentage⟯), or ⟮multiplied by 1000⟯, to ⟮present a number/index⟯ 

What we often call ⟮birth rate⟯ is more properly called the ⟮crude birth rate⟯, because ⟮it isn't directly based on anything related to childbirth⟯ 
The ⟮crude birth rate⟯ is ⟮the number of live births⟯ ⟮per person⟯ 
To get ⟮the crude birth rate⟯ in practice, we ⟮divide the number of live births through the population size⟯ 

The ⟮general fertility rate⟯ is ⟮the amount of live births⟯ ⟮per women aged 15 to 44 (women of childbearing age⟯) 

The ⟮age-specific fertility rate⟯ is ⟮the number of births⟯ ⟮to women in a given age group⟯ ⟮divided by the number of women in a given age group⟯ 
The ⟮ASFR⟯ is often ⟮grouped in groups of⟯ ⟮1⟯ or ⟮5⟯ ⟮years⟯. 
In plain language, the ⟮ASFR⟯ e.g. for age 21 is ⟮the amount of children an average 21 y/o has in a year⟯ 

The ⟮TFR⟯ measures ⟮babies per woman (in her lifetime⟯) (*) 
Mathematically, the ⟮total fertility rate⟯ is ⟮the sum of all⟯ ⟮current age-specific fertility rates⟯ 
In plain language, the ⟮TFR⟯ is ⟮the sum of⟯ ⟮the amount of chilren⟯ ⟮a women will have⟯ ⟮in any given year of her life⟯ 
The thing the ⟮total fertility rate⟯ is ⟮trying to estimate⟯ is ⟮the amount of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime (subject to some theoretical assumptions⟯) 
The ⟮total fertility rate⟯ assumes that ⟮the woman will survive until the end of her reproductive life⟯ and that ⟮she will to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime⟯ 
If a ⟮woman dies before her reproductive period ends (lets say at 30),⟯ she ⟮will not impact ASFRs beyond 30⟯. This is not a problem until ⟮we add them together to the TFR⟯ - since we are using the ASFRs to ⟮estimate how many children a woman will have in her life⟯, ⟮the ASFRs⟯ ⟮should be impacted b⟯⟮y the woman who died before the end of the reproductive period (the dead women should count as 0⟯). Therefore, ⟮maternal mortality distorts the TFR⟯. 


The ⟮replacement rate / replacement-level fertility⟯ is ⟮the TFR⟯ ⟮needed to sustain population levels⟯ 
A ⟮TFR⟯ ⟮below replacement rate⟯ is known as ⟮Sub-replacement fertility⟯ 
Beyond ⟮the distorting factors for the TFR⟯, ⟮the replacement rate⟯ is additionally distorted by ⟮child mortality⟯. 
⟮The replacement rate⟯ for countries ⟮with low child and maternal mortality⟯ is ⟮about 2.1⟯.

### dependency

#### definition of dependent

In demographics/economics, a ⟮dependent⟯ is someone ⟮who relies on someone else for financial support.⟯
For statistical purposes, it is generally assumed that ⟮those aged 15-64⟯ are ⟮non-dependents⟯, and ⟮those aged 0-14 and 65-⟯ are ⟮dependents⟯.
The relationship of ⟮dependents per non-dependent⟯ is expressed ⟮in the dependency ratio⟯.

#### dependency ratio

The ⟮dependency ratio (amount of people who work divided by people who can't⟯) is used as a proxy for ⟮pressure on the productive population⟯,
A ⟮lower⟯ ⟮dependency ratio⟯ is generally better because it often results in ⟮economic growth⟯.
When ⟮a change to a lower dependency ratio leads to economic growth⟯, which is most often caused when there is a ⟮high fertility rate⟯, resulting in ⟮a bunch of young people⟯, followed by ⟮a decrease in fertility⟯, and often ⟮augmented by an increase in life expectancy⟯, this is termed a ⟮demographic dividend⟯.
the idea of a ⟮demographic dividend⟯ is used to explain e.g. ⟮China's rapid economic growth⟯ - in ⟮2010⟯ they had an unprecedented ⟮dependency ratio⟯ of ⟮35%⟯, at the a time where the world average was ⟮53%⟯.
Of course, ⟮this large group of young people⟯ responsible for a ⟮demographic dividend⟯ will ⟮eventually grow old⟯, with ⟮less young people to support them⟯, leading to ⟮an increased dependency ratio⟯. this has been termed the ⟮demographic tax⟯ or ⟮demographic burden⟯.
A ⟮demographic burden/tax results⟯ in ⟮lower economic growth⟯ - a fact ⟮Japan⟯ ⟮is currently experiencing⟯ and ⟮China⟯ ⟮probably will fall victim to as well⟯.

### sex/gender

#### missing women

The term "⟮missing women⟯" (coined by ⟮Amartya Sen⟯) indicates a shortfall in ⟮the number of women⟯ relative to ⟮the expected number of women⟯ in ⟮a region or country⟯. 
⟮missing women⟯ are often measured/discovered through ⟮male-to-female sex ratios⟯, specifically via ⟮the deviance from⟯ the ⟮natural roughly 1:1 m:f ratio (in fact, in the west it is generally 0.98:1⟯) 
⟮Sen⟯ argued that there were about ⟮100 million⟯ ⟮"missing women"⟯ in ⟮Asia⟯. 
The phenomenon of ⟮missing women⟯ and is theorized to be caused by ⟮sex-selective abortions⟯, ⟮female infanticide⟯, and ⟮inadequate healthcare and nutrition for female children⟯. 
The fact of the existence of missing women is caused by ⟮sexism⟯, and may be seen as a pretty direct expression of ⟮their -value status.⟯

#### narration

⟮Protofeminism⟯ is a term for ⟮activity or thought⟯ that is ⟮seen to be similar to feminism⟯, but ⟮before arrival of the movement itself⟯, i.e. ⟮before the 20th century⟯, or sometimes ⟮before the 18th century⟯ 

Mary Wollstonecraft lived in the 2nd half of the 1700s.
Mary Wollstonecraft is often called a proto-feminist, mainly due to her most well-known work 『A Vindication of the Rights of Woman』
Mary Wollstonecraft helped her sister Eliza to leave her husband and infant after (probably) postpartum depression, resulting in Eliza escaping the situation, but also in the social condemnation of her Mary 
Wollstonecraft had a close friendship with Jane Arden, valuing the intellectual atmosphere and also saying I have formed romantic notions of friendship ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none. 
In general, Mary Wollstonecrafts life was more popular a subject than her other writings (however some argue that this may have been overstated) until the advent of the feminist movement, then especially focusing on the 『Vindication of the Rights of Woman』 
As well as for her work, Mary Wollstonecraft is often admired for her unconventional personal relationships, which consisted of two affairs and then marrying a philosopher, after which she gave birth to Mary (Wollstonecraft) Shelley and then died due to complications

⟮Ada Lovelace⟯ was ⟮the only child⟯ of ⟮Lord Byron⟯ and ⟮the mathematician Lady Byron⟯ 
⟮Ada Lovelace⟯ was ⟮the wife⟯ of ⟮Charles Babbaage⟯ 
The ⟮programming language Ada⟯ is named after ⟮Ada Lovelace⟯ 

⟮smoking⟯ by women was ⟮seen as inappropriate/treated with disdain⟯ up to and including ⟮the beginning of the 20th century (though I don't want to make a claim if this was always this way or only started with e.g. victorian social mores⟯) 
⟮Torches of Freedom⟯ was a phrase used to ⟮encourage Women's smoking⟯ by ⟮connecting it with women's liberation⟯, promoted by both ⟮cigarette companies⟯ and ⟮feminist activists⟯ 

⟮The Second Sex⟯ is often regarded as ⟮the starting point/prefiguring⟯ of ⟮second-wave feminism⟯ 
From "⟮The Second Sex⟯" by ⟮Simone de Beavoir⟯, the famous statement "⟮One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman⟯" is oftain said to prefigure the ⟮Sex/Gender distinction⟯ (it's however not a perfect fit). 

The ⟮National Organization for Women⟯ ⟮(c:1;NOW⟯) was founded  in ⟮1966⟯ and led by ⟮Betty Friedan⟯ 
The ⟮Feminine Mystique⟯ is a book by ⟮Betty Friedan⟯ that is widely credited with ⟮sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism⟯ in the United States. 

⟮The Woman-Identified Woman⟯ (by ⟮Radicalesbians⟯) argues that ⟮heterosexuality⟯ necessarily leads to women ⟮serving/spending their time on⟯ and ⟮defining themselves by/as a negative to (in a Master-Slave dialectic sense))⟯ men (the whole package is called a "⟮man-identified woman⟯"), leaving her ⟮empty⟯. Only via turning towards ⟮lesbianism⟯ can a woman first ⟮recognize her own slaveness/otherness/emptiness⟯, and thus not ⟮merely be defined by a negative⟯, but ⟮by herself and her sisterhood with other women⟯ (and become a "⟮woman-identified woman⟯")

⟮Adrienne Rich⟯ was a influential ⟮lesbian⟯ ⟮feminist⟯ who wrote the ⟮1980⟯ essay "⟮Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence⟯", whence ⟮the relevant concept⟯ 

⟮Political lesbianism⟯ sees ⟮becoming lesbian/sexual orientation⟯ as ⟮a choice⟯ that one could undertake for a variety of reasons, e.g. ⟮as a preconditon for lesbian separatism⟯ and ⟮becoming a woman-identified women (a la radicalesbians)⟯
⟮Feminist seperatism/separatist feminism⟯ is the idea that ⟮women's liberation can best be achieved⟯ via ⟮women's separation from men⟯. The most advocated position might be ⟮lesbian separatism⟯, which also emphasized ⟮a turn towards lesbiansim⟯.
⟮Lesbian feminism⟯ in general was ⟮a reaction to⟯ not ⟮being seen fully as a part of⟯ ⟮gay⟯ and ⟮feminist⟯ activism, perhaps most exemplefied by ⟮Betty Friedan⟯ calling them a "⟮lavender menace⟯" in ⟮1969⟯, triggering the ⟮1970⟯ ⟮interruption⟯ of ⟮the Congress to Unite Women⟯ by the ⟮Radicalesbians⟯ with their "⟮The Woman-Identified Woman⟯"
⟮Lesbian feminism⟯ is either concerned with ⟮the relevant intersectional category⟯, or a feminist movements that emphasizes ⟮focusing on activities towards women⟯, perhaps with ⟮lesbianism as the logical result of feminism⟯. It was ⟮most influential⟯ in ⟮the 1970s and early 1980s⟯.

the ⟮lesbian⟯/⟮feminist⟯/ø ⟮sex⟯/⟮porn⟯ ⟮wars⟯ refer to a ⟮set of debates⟯ about ⟮sexuality⟯ and in particular ⟮pornography⟯, ⟮BDSM⟯, and ⟮prostitution⟯ and ⟮their relationship to feminism⟯ in the ⟮1970s and 80s⟯

### branches

### feminism and social class

#### double burden/second shoft

## trans

### confusion

⟮Transgender OCD⟯ consists of obsessive thoughts of the kind ⟮"What if I'm actually trans?" "What if I'm actually living a lie?"⟯ 

### identities

#### transvestism

⟮Transvestism⟯ is an ⟮older⟯ term (coined in ⟮the 1910s⟯) today ⟮more or less synonymous⟯ with ⟮cross-dressing⟯, although in the past ⟮it was also used for trans people (mirroring the general confusion about Transness⟯). 

#### travesti

The term ⟮travesti⟯ is used in ⟮Latin American⟯ countries—especially ⟮South American⟯—to designate people who were ⟮assigned male at birth⟯, but develop a gender identity according to different expressions of ⟮femininity⟯, 
⟮Travesti⟯ ⟮expression of femininity⟯ may be ⟮limited to cross-dressing⟯, or ⟮going whole hog with female names, cosmetic practises, hormone replacement therapy etc.⟯ 
⟮Travesti⟯ may ⟮identify⟯ as ⟮men or women⟯, more often they ⟮identify⟯ as ⟮a third gender⟯ or otherwise ⟮define their gender identity differently⟯. 
⟮Travesti⟯ generally face ⟮extreme marginalization⟯: Generally suffering ⟮childhood sexual abuse⟯, ⟮disowned from their families⟯ and ⟮removed from the education system⟯, with ⟮lack of access⟯ to ⟮housing⟯ and ⟮work⟯, they live in ⟮deficient housing⟯ ⟮(c:14;50⟯%) and often work ⟮as sex workers⟯ ⟮(c:14;70⟯%), often ⟮contracting HIV/AIDS⟯. 
⟮Travesti⟯ suffer from ⟮extremely high rates⟯ of ⟮hate crimes⟯ and ⟮murder⟯ as well as ⟮arbitrary detention⟯ up to ⟮torture⟯, and have a life expectancy of ⟮30 - 35⟯ years. 
⟮Often⟯, travesti ⟮use this term for themselves⟯ to ⟮highlight their marginalization as well as their gender identity⟯, nevertheless, the term is ⟮sometimes⟯ used ⟮as a translation of english terms such as transgender/trans/etc⟯, in these cases, it is often a ⟮slur⟯.

#### macro

##### food energy

⟮Food energy⟯ is ⟮energy⟯ derived from ⟮food⟯ 
⟮Food energy⟯ is generally measured in ⟮kilocalories⟯ 
the ⟮calorie⟯, in its proper definition, is ⟮the amount of energy⟯  ⟮needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one Kelvin / deg C⟯ 

Foods by food energy per mass:
1. ⟮fats⟯ 
2. ⟮alcohol(ethanol⟯) 
3. ⟮carbohydrates⟯/⟮protein⟯
⟮calorie⟯ is also sometimes called ⟮small calorie⟯, ⟮gram calorie⟯
⟮kilocalorie⟯ is also sometimes called ⟮calorie (confusingly, and mainly in casual conversation)⟯ ⟮large calorie⟯, ⟮food calorie⟯

⟮calorie⟯ is also sometimes nonstandardly called ⟮small calorie⟯, ⟮gram calorie⟯ 
⟮kilocalorie⟯ is also sometimes nonstandardly called ⟮calorie (confusingly, and mainly in casual conversation⟯) ⟮large calorie⟯, ⟮food calorie⟯ 

###### carbs

⟮Saccharide⟯ is as far as I know a synonym for ⟮Carbohydrate⟯ 
Carbohydrates may be classified as ⟮monosaccharides⟯, ⟮disaccharides⟯ or ⟮polysaccharides⟯ 

###### protein

⟮Proteins⟯ are made up of ⟮amino acids⟯ 
⟮Amino acids⟯ are ⟮organic⟯ compounds that contain ⟮amino⟯ (–NH2) and ⟮carboxyl⟯ (–COOH) ⟮functional⟯ groups, along with a ⟮side chain⟯ ⟮(c:6;R⟯ group) ⟮specific to⟯ each ⟮amino acid⟯
The key elements of an ⟮amino acid⟯ are ⟮carbon⟯, ⟮hydrogen⟯, ⟮oxygen⟯, and ⟮nitrogen⟯, although the ⟮side chains⟯ sometimes ⟮include others⟯
of the ⟮21⟯ ⟮amino acids⟯ common to all life forms, for humans, ⟮nine⟯ are ⟮essential⟯, ⟮six⟯ are ⟮conditionally essential⟯ ⟮(c:19;synthesis may be limited by circumstances⟯), and ⟮six⟯ are ⟮non-essential⟯

###### fats

⟮Fat⟯ consists of (is an ester of, whatever that means) ⟮fatty acids⟯ 
⟮Fatty acids⟯ may either be ⟮saturated⟯ or ⟮unsaturated⟯. 
⟮Unsaturated⟯ ⟮fatty acids⟯ ones have ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮C=C double bonds⟯.⟮saturated⟯ factty acids have ⟮no⟯ ⟮C=C double bonds⟯. 
⟮Saturated fats⟯ are called that because they have the ⟮maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms⟯ attached to ⟮every carbon atom⟯, and thus no ⟮need (or possibility⟯) for ⟮double C=C bonds⟯ 
Unsaturated fats with ⟮one⟯ ⟮C=C double bond(s⟯) are called ⟮monounsaturated⟯ 
Unsaturated fats with ⟮two or more⟯ ⟮C=C double bond(s⟯) ⟮polyunsaturated⟯ 
Since ⟮cis⟯ and ⟮trans⟯ fats refer to the ⟮configuration of the molecule⟯ ⟮around the C=C double bond⟯, only ⟮unsaturated⟯ fats can be ⟮cis⟯ or ⟮trans⟯. 
since an ⟮unsaturated fatty acid⟯ can have ⟮more than one double bond⟯, it can be ⟮both cis and trans⟯ 
There are two ⟮essential⟯ fatty acids (EFAs) in human nutrition: ⟮alpha-linolenic acid⟯ (an ⟮omega-3 fatty acid⟯) and ⟮linoleic acid⟯ (an ⟮omega-6 fatty acid⟯). ⟮Other lipids needed by the body⟯ ⟮can be synthesized from these and other fats.⟯ 
Of the three main types of omega-3 fatty acids, ⟮plant foods⟯ typically contain ⟮only alpha-linolenic acid (ALA⟯). 

####### health

While the research is not completely settled, ⟮saturated⟯ and ⟮trans unsaturated fats⟯ are generally considered ⟮unhealthy⟯ and ⟮cis unsaturated fats⟯ considered ⟮healthy⟯

####### unsaturated

######### omega-3

There are three types of ⟮omega-3⟯ fatty acids, ⟮ALA⟯, ⟮EPA⟯, and ⟮DHA⟯.
of the ⟮three⟯ types of ⟮omega-3⟯ fatty acids relevant to human nutrition, only ⟮ALA⟯ is ⟮essential⟯.

Of the omega-3 fatty acids, only ⟮ALA⟯ is essential since ⟮EPA⟯ and ⟮DHA⟯ can be ⟮synthesized from the former⟯.
⟮EPA/DHA synthesis from ALA⟯ may be impaired in ⟮aging⟯ and generally is not a ⟮particularly efficient process⟯, as such, ⟮making sure to consume EPA/DHA⟯ is probably advisable.

#### micro

##### genesis

⟮Minerals⟯ ⟮end up in food⟯ via ⟮rock, soil, and water,⟯ which are ⟮absorbed by plants as they grow (or e.g. by animals licking rocks⟯), and then ⟮passed further up the food chain⟯. 
⟮What minerals we get⟯ from plants/animals depends on ⟮which they can store⟯, but also ⟮what the soil/animals further down the food chain had in them⟯. 
⟮Vitamins⟯ are ⟮biosynthesized⟯ by ⟮plants/animals⟯ and then ⟮absorbed by us⟯. 
⟮Which vitamins⟯ are ⟮contained in food⟯ depend on ⟮what the relevant vegetable or animal can biosythesize⟯. 

##### vitamins

Theoretically, all ⟮vitamins⟯ are defined to be ⟮essential nutrients⟯, however ⟮Vitamin D⟯ can be synthesized if ⟮exposed to sunlight (specifically UVB rays⟯), and is thus ⟮an exception⟯ 
Most ⟮vitamins⟯ are not ⟮single molecules⟯, but ⟮groups of related molecules⟯ which are each called ⟮vitamers⟯ 
Each ⟮vitamin⟯ is typically used in ⟮multiple reactions⟯, and therefore ⟮most have multiple functions⟯. 
⟮Vitamin B12⟯ is ⟮the only⟯ vitamin or nutrient ⟮not available from plant sources.⟯ 
⟮Vitamins⟯ are generally categorized as either ⟮water⟯- or ⟮fat⟯ soluble 
The ⟮water-soluble vitamins (the 8 B vitamins and vitamin C⟯) are ⟮easily excreted from the body⟯, thus generally ⟮hypervitaminosis (if referring to high storage levels⟯) is not an issue, therefore, however, ⟮consistent consumption is required⟯. 
Of the ⟮fat-soluble⟯ vitamins, ⟮A⟯ and ⟮D⟯ can ⟮accumulate in the body to a dangerous level⟯, resulting in ⟮hypervitaminosis⟯ 
⟮Hypervitaminosis⟯ is a condition of abnormally high ⟮storage levels (most of the time, although some sources also just use it for any overdose⟯) of ⟮vitamins⟯ 
In general, ⟮excess intake⟯ of vitamins is ⟮unlikely⟯ from ⟮food sources⟯, but possible via ⟮supplements⟯ 



Common Designation|More Properly
⟮Vitamin C⟯|⟮Ascorbic acid⟯


###### vitamin D

⟮Vitamin D⟯ deficiency is common worldwide, occurring in about a ⟮1 billion⟯ people, and is surprisingly common in ⟮europe⟯. 
⟮Vitamin D⟯ has many function, amongst the most important being ⟮increasing the absorption⟯ of ⟮minerals⟯ such as ⟮calcium, magnesium, and phosphate⟯ 
⟮Vitamin D⟯ ⟮deficiency⟯ can cause or excarbate a wide variety of conditions, many featuring ⟮bone⟯ or ⟮muscle⟯ ⟮weakness⟯, and some ⟮respiratiory infections⟯ as well as ⟮mental illnesses⟯ 
⟮Rickets⟯ is a condition that results in ⟮weak⟯ and ⟮soft⟯ ⟮bones⟯ in ⟮children⟯ 

⟮Vitamin D⟯ occurs only ⟮rarely⟯ in food, specifically in ⟮oily fish⟯ such as ⟮salmon/herring/mackerel⟯ as well as ⟮mushrooms⟯ (if these have been ⟮exposed to UVB ligh ≈ been in the sun⟯) 
While ⟮Vitamin D⟯ can be synthesized by contact with ⟮UVB⟯ rays from ⟮sunlight⟯, many people ⟮do not do this enough⟯, it is not necessarily possible in ⟮winter⟯, and may not be ⟮advisable⟯ due to ⟮skin cancer risk⟯ 
In the ⟮US⟯ and some other countries, ⟮milk⟯ and ⟮milk substitutes⟯ as well as ⟮breakfast cereals⟯ are fortified with ⟮Vitamin D⟯.

##### minerals

⟮Minerals⟯ are ⟮micronutrients⟯ that ⟮are inorganic chemical elements⟯ 

###### macro/trace/ultratrace

⟮Minerals⟯ as micronutrients are subcategorized (by ⟮amount necessary⟯) into ⟮macrominerals⟯, ⟮trace minerals⟯, and ⟮ultratrace minerals⟯. 
There are many ⟮ultratrace⟯ elements that have been ⟮suggested as essential⟯, such claims are ⟮difficult to reproduce⟯.

###### various minerals

####### calcium

⟮Calcium⟯ most famously exists in ⟮dairy⟯, but ⟮also in other things.⟯ 

####### iron

⟮Iron⟯ ⟮from food⟯ comes in two forms, ⟮heme⟯ ⟮iron⟯ which can only be gotten from ⟮animal flesh⟯, and ⟮non-heme⟯ ⟮iron⟯ which can also be gotten from ⟮other sources⟯ 
⟮Heme⟯ iron is ⟮better absorbed⟯ by the body than ⟮non-heme⟯ iron. 
Iron from ⟮non-heme⟯ sources is ⟮more readily absorbed⟯ if ⟮consumed with foods⟯ that contain either ⟮heme-bound iron⟯ or ⟮vitamin C⟯. 

####### iodine

⟮Iodine⟯ ⟮deficiency⟯ leads to many bad outcomes, many due to the fact that ⟮iodine⟯ is necessary to ⟮make one of the thyroid hormones (thyroxine⟯), lack of which leads to ⟮high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH⟯), causing ⟮the thyroid to swell⟯ 
in many countries, ⟮table salt⟯ is fortified with ⟮iodine⟯ in the form of ⟮iodine⟯ ⟮salts⟯, which has proved effective at preventing ⟮iodine⟯ ⟮deficiency⟯ 
In Deutschland kommen Iodverbindungen ⟮in den Böden⟯ unverändert ⟮in zu geringen Mengen vor⟯. Durch ⟮die Iodierung von Speisesalz⟯ ist ⟮der Iodmangel in Deutschland verringert worden⟯, dennoch besteht in Deutschland bei ⟮36⟯ % der Bevölkerung ein ⟮milder⟯ und bei ⟮21⟯ % ein ⟮moderater bis schwerer⟯ ⟮Iodmangel⟯. 

##### choline

Choline is a micronutrient that is neither a mineral nor a vitamin.
⟮Choline⟯ is available in what feels like ⟮just about any food⟯, but is genrally highest in ⟮animal products (meat/fish/dairy/eggs⟯), which is why it is sometimes said ⟮vegans should pay some attention to it⟯ (prob not necessary tho).

###### testicular self-examination

General medical advice is to self-examine ⟮one's testicles⟯ ⟮once a month⟯ to check for ⟮testicular cancer.⟯ 
When ⟮self-examining ones testicles,⟯ the two parts are to ⟮feel them once-over⟯ and to ⟮measure them⟯. 
When measuring your testicles, having ⟮one testicle be larger than the other⟯ is ⟮normal⟯, what you want to look out for is ⟮size changes diachronically⟯. 
When ⟮feeling your testicles⟯, you're feeling for ⟮lumps/bumps or similar⟯, representing ⟮possible tumors⟯. Generally, these are ⟮painless⟯, though ⟮a dull soreness⟯ in ⟮your whole testicles⟯ is also ⟮something to keep an eye out for⟯.

##### appendix ＆ appendicitis

⟮Appendicitis⟯ is the english and formally correct name for ⟮Blinddarmentzündung⟯. 
Der ⟮Wurmfortsatz des Blinddarms⟯ is the german name for ⟮appendix⟯. 
⟮appendicitis⟯ is ⟮inflammation of⟯ ⟮the appendix⟯ 
⟮The inflammation of the appendix that is appendicitis⟯ is often caused by ⟮a blockage of the appendix⟯. 
⟮The blockage of the appendix leading to appendicitis⟯ is most commonly due to ⟮a calcified 'stone' made of feces⟯. Due to this reason, ⟮a high-fiber diet⟯ reduces ⟮the long-term risk of appendicitis⟯. 
The risk of getting ⟮appendicitis⟯ at some point in your life is ⟮7-8⟯%, most commonly in ⟮those under 30⟯. 
There is ⟮c+;a cluster ofsigns＆symptoms⟯ associated with ⟮appendicitis⟯, but ⟮a fairly high percentage (40%⟯) ⟮do not present most/all of the typical symptoms⟯, and ⟮a smaller percentage⟯ may have ⟮their pain be located differently⟯, due to ⟮the appendix itself being in a different location⟯. 
The ⟮pain⟯ for ⟮appendicitis⟯ generally appears relatively ⟮suddenly⟯ ⟮near or above the belly button⟯, ⟮from where it then moves⟯ ⟮into the right lower belly⟯. 
The ⟮pain⟯ for ⟮appendicitis⟯ is usually ⟮strong⟯ and ⟮gets worse⟯ with ⟮(esp. jarring) movement⟯ (one can test for this by ⟮jumping up or down⟯). 
⟮The hamburger sign⟯ is used for ⟮assessing if the person has appendicitis⟯: the person ⟮is asked if they would like to eat their favorite food⟯: A ⟮positive hamburger sign⟯ is ⟮them declining the food⟯, with ⟮a sensitivity (true postive rate⟯) of ⟮80%⟯. 
One of the symptoms of ⟮appendicitis⟯ is ⟮stiff⟯ ⟮belly muscles⟯. Connected to this is ⟮rebound tenderness⟯: If you ⟮press on your belly for a while⟯, and then ⟮suddenly release⟯, the ⟮main pain⟯ will be ⟮on release (though the initial press will also hurt⟯) 
To determine the exisitence of ⟮appendicitis⟯ with certainty, ⟮CT/ultrasound⟯ is needed. 
If ⟮appendicitis is left untreated⟯, ⟮the appendix may burst⟯, causing ⟮the inflammation of the interior abdominal wall (peritonitis⟯). Once this has happened, there is ⟮a high risk of death⟯. 
⟮Appendicitis⟯ is also often accomodated by ⟮nausea⟯ and ⟮vomiting⟯.

##### thrombi

What we call ⟮a blood clot⟯ is more properly called ⟮thrombus⟯. 
⟮Thrombosis⟯ is the formation of ⟮a thrombus⟯ ⟮inside a blood vessel⟯ that ⟮obstructs the flow of blood⟯. 
If ⟮the thrombus then breaks free⟯, it becomes an ⟮embolus⟯. 
if ⟮a thrombus⟯, after ⟮breaking free and becoming an embolus⟯ ⟮get lodged again⟯, that is a form ⟮embolism⟯, specifically a ⟮s10;⟮thromboembolism⟯⟯. 
Based on where they occur, ⟮thromboses⟯ are classified into ⟮venous⟯ and ⟮arterial⟯. 

###### thromboses

⟮Thromboses⟯ most often occur in ⟮the veins⟯ of ⟮the legs⟯, other bodyparts are ⟮affected far more rarely⟯. 
If you have a ⟮thrombosis⟯, your limb, esp. your leg, will often become some of the following:  ⟮swollen::size⟯, ⟮turn red or blue::color⟯, ⟮have more visible veins::appearance of thing⟯, ⟮be shiny due to taut::surface appearance⟯, ⟮may feel more heavy::feeling⟯, ⟮be warmer::feeling⟯, and ⟮hurt quite severely, especially while stepping::pain⟯. 
⟮Thromboses⟯ are often caused by ⟮not moving that bodypart for a while⟯, e.g. ⟮because of an illness that prevents it⟯ 
If ⟮a thrombus blocks the blood vessel completely⟯, ⟮the surrounding tissue will start to die⟯.

##### emboli

An ⟮embolus⟯ is ⟮some kind of foreign object⟯ (amongst others: ⟮s1:2;⟮thrombi⟯, ⟮fat globules, gas bubbles, cholesterol plaque/crystals⟯⟯ ) that ⟮travels through the bloodstream⟯. 
If an ⟮embolus⟯ ⟮gets lodged⟯ and thus ⟮s6;⟮blocks a blood vessel⟯⟯, this is known as an ⟮embolism⟯. ⟮s6:8;If it's ⟮a thrombus⟯ that ⟮gets lodged⟯, it is known as a ⟮thromboembolism⟯.⟯ 

###### pulmonary embolism

The ⟮severity of the effects⟯ of ⟮an embolism⟯ vary based on ⟮location (in the body⟯). 
One of ⟮the most severe types⟯ of embolism is ⟮pulmonary embolism⟯, i.e. ⟮embolism in the lungs⟯. 
If ⟮a pulmonary embolism⟯ ⟮is caused by thrombosis⟯ (as is ⟮common⟯), it is known as ⟮a pulmonary thromboembolism⟯. 
On average, the risk of experiencing a ⟮pulmonary embolism⟯ is ⟮0.1% in one year⟯, the ⟮mortality⟯ is ⟮10%⟯. It ⟮gets more common⟯ with ⟮age⟯. 
⟮Pulmonary embolisms⟯ produce the symptoms of ⟮rapid⟯ ⟮breathing⟯ and ⟮heartrate⟯, ⟮general malaise/a light fever⟯, ⟮shortness of breath⟯, ⟮chest pain⟯, ⟮coughing blood⟯ and up to ⟮passing out.⟯

### principles

⟮SSC (Safe, sane and consensual⟯) is the most well-known ⟮set of principles⟯ for ⟮BDSM⟯. 
Criticisms of ⟮SSC⟯ are ⟮"sane" imposing unexamined norms⟯, and ⟮no⟯ ⟮BDSM⟯ activity ⟮being completely safe (see also "saf⁑er⁑sex"⟯)
the alternative to ⟮SSC⟯ is ⟮RACK (risk-aware consensual kink⟯)

Henceforth, I will abbreviate top/bottom, dom/sub, sadist/masochist, fem(me)/masc as TBDSSMFM.
Generally, a ⟮person who will adopt either of the relevant binary roles of TBDSSMFM⟯ is known as ⟮a switch⟯, except for ⟮penentration⟯, where they are generally known ⟮as versatile⟯.
⟮TBDSSMFM⟯ may be used as ⟮any of the 'big' word types (lexical categories), i.e. noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.⟯
For ⟮any of TBDSSMFM⟯, different people may see these as having ⟮a ⁑scope⁑⟯ ⟮limited to sex⟯, or ⟮encompassing a larger part of their life⟯.
For ⟮any of TBDSSMFM⟯, different people may see these as having ⟮a ⁑duration⁑⟯ of ⟮a short while⟯ to ⟮ones whole life⟯.
For ⟮any of TBDSSMFM⟯, some people may see it as an ( ⟮chosen⟯ or ⟮inborn = 'essentialized'⟯ ) ⟮identity⟯, ⟮a preference⟯, ⟮a role in the relationship⟯ or ⟮in a specific encounter/scene⟯ (or any combination).
The ⟮distinction between the different parts of TBDSSMFM⟯ is ⟮most clear in the BDSM community⟯
the distinction between parts of TBDSSMFM ⟮may be more vague⟯ ⟮in other communities⟯, especially in ⟮queer and fandom communities⟯.
As of 2021, ⟮all the TBDSSMFM identities⟯ are often ⟮conflated into a giant superidentity⟯, most often ⟮just called top/bottom⟯ or ⟮masc(or butch)/femme⟯.
This ⟮top/bottom superidentity⟯ is then most often also seen as having ⟮a scope⟯ of ⟮many/all aspects of ones life⟯, ⟮a duration⟯ of ⟮one's whole life⟯, and ⟮an identity that is essentialized⟯. This seems to me basically like ⟮the hegemonic (= mainstream) idea of masculinity⟯.
This is also supported by the fact that ⟮people⟯ (or ⟮fictional characters⟯) who ⟮subscribe to the top/bottom superidentity⟯ also ⟮then engage in misogynist/sexist practices/beliefs/etc.⟯

§ Further notes: §
often in dominance and submission, the ⟮dominants⟯ ⟮name⟯, ⟮pronouns⟯ or ⟮the relevant letter⟯ will be ⟮capitalized⟯, while the ⟮submissives⟯ ⟮name⟯, ⟮pronouns⟯ or ⟮the relevant letter⟯ will be ⟮written in lower case⟯
A ⟮pillow princess⟯ is a ⟮lesbian⟯ who is ⟮very bottom,⟯ to the point of ⟮not reciprocating⟯
a ⟮power bottom⟯ is most commonly just a misnomer for a ⟮dominant bottom⟯, but ⟮ is also used for all kinds of things, including the absolute opposite⟯ 
"⟮Topping from the bottom⟯" using the ⟮literal sense⟯ ⟮doesn't make sense⟯ and may refer to "⟮being a dom and a bottom AT THE SAME TIME :OOOOOOOOOOO⟯" or "⟮Being a sub in theory but a dom in practice⟯". It is also often just used for "⟮My sub is doing something and ＊I don't like it＊⟯"

In general, as of 2021, it seems that more "⟮masc⟯" gay identities are ⟮more highly valued⟯

### violence

#### behavioral and structural

⟮Structural violence⟯ is ⟮the tangible harm⟯ done by ⟮social structures⟯. 
⟮behavioral violence⟯ is ⟮the tangible harm⟯ done ⟮by agents volitionally⟯ 
⟮Structural violence⟯ is contrasted with ⟮behavioral violence⟯. 
However, in a second analysis, we might argue that ⟮we can reduce behavioral violence to structural violence⟯, for example via the concepts of ⟮stochastic/scripted terrorism/violence⟯ 
⟮about 300k deaths in a year in the US are attributable to income inequality⟯ is an example of ⟮structural violence⟯ 
⟮"Over 20 years’ worth of studies show that people of color who arrive at a hospital while having a heart attack are significantly less likely to receive aspirin, beta-blocking drugs, clot-dissolving drugs, acute cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, or bypass surgery."⟯ is an example of ⟮structural violence⟯ 

##### stochastic violence

⟮Stochastic violence⟯ is the idea of ⟮spreading a violent message via mass communication⟯, which ⟮makes resulting acts of violence⟯ ⟮probable⟯, but ⟮the actual place and time of the occurrence are⟯ ⟮random⟯. 
⟮Stochastic violence⟯ used for ⟮terrorism⟯ is called ⟮stochastic terrorism⟯ 
By ⟮transforming⟯ ⟮lone wolves⟯ ⟮into⟯ ⟮instances of larger patterns of violent messages⟯, ⟮stochastic violence⟯ ⟮unmasks behavioural violence⟯ as ⟮structural violence⟯ (perhaps) 
⟮Scripted violence⟯ is where ⟮someone describes the kind of violence they want to be carried out⟯, and then ⟮leaves it up to the audience to carry out this violence⟯. It may be seen as an instace of ⟮attempted stochastic violence/terrorism⟯

### +/-

any ism describes a structural system fundamentally defined by the contrast between two states/attributes, real or supposed.
For any ism, one state gets accorded significantly more of a bunch of positive stuff (influence, value, care, visibility etc.) while the other state gets accorded less or the opposite of this positive stuff, hence I call these states the + and - identity respectively.
+ and - also get other traits attached to them, creating two characters/charicatures, which are also placed in a contrastive relationship, which I call +traits and -traits as well as +characters and -characters.
+ and - also have a set of traits that constitute ideals for +/-ists while also being naturalized, which is called hegemonic +/-ity.
+ and - also of course create two groups of people who are in a + and a - state respectively, which I will call +ists and -ists respectively.
the experience that people with +/- identities = +/- experiences
Ambiguity is generally not tolerated, + and - are meant to be disjoint and S+ ∩ S- = U.
The power structure that an -ism establishes is called an -archy.
The totality of benefits that accrue to +ists because of an ism is »priviledge«.

For some isms, there seem to some to be an actual natural basis for the categorization into + and -, for those there have been attempts to separate + and - identities from their supposed natural bases. For me, I assume + and - are entirely socially constructed, and thus my models of isms rely on the separation or dismissal of any natural basis.

#### being-seen

throughout discourse (in the wide focaultian sense), +ists as well as the +experience is prioritized, thus the visibility of -ists and their experience is reduced:

x-normativity normalizes the + identity, experience and being a +ist of the relevant ism.
x-centrism places the + experience at the center of concern in a wide variety of areas, such that the + experience becomes enmeshed in the fabric of the social and built world.
Often x-normativity gives rise to one or more υ-cultures.
The sanctions that -ists face are such that many hide their - identity (stealth ＆ passing), thus the visibility of the - identity is further reduced.

Lack of visibility of - experiences, - identities, and -ists constitutes »erasure«.

The various ways in which the + experiences is prioritized and - visibility is reduced leads to low understanding for the - experience.
The - experience being not well understood is strengthened by and leads to more covering.
the - experience being not well understood and the traits associated with the -often leads to victim-blaming in response to violence against -ists.

+ traits are seen as (morally/value) good, and - traits as (morally/value) bad
- traits are seen to contain the seeds of evil, leading to a number of tropes with this premise.
- traits being seen as bad encourages pick-me x to act in such a way, in turn strenthening the idea of - traits as bad.
Due to - identity and traits being seen as undesirable, people with a - identity should wish to have a + identity instead.
x hegemony is the hierarchy between hegemonic +istity and hegemonic -istity.
x-normativity often causes equality to be identified as everyone becoming more like hegemonic +istity.
Besides the violence that having a - identity incurs, a mismatch between actual traits and traits expected by hegemonic - ity can produce sanctions, but so can having actual traits expected by hegemonic - ity = the double bind.
Hyper -ity is the extreme pursuit of the hegemonic -ity corresponding with one's - identity.
A model minority is a (part of a) - identity some of whose traits are seen positively.
A model minority's positively-seen traits serve to naturalize their negatively seen traits.
A model minority's positively-seen traits serve to contrast with other subidentities of the - identity.

+ fragility is the state in which having ⟮the relevant ism privilege mentioned⟯, even ⟮in a minor way⟯, ⟮triggers a deep defensive response⟯. This reaction functions (on a societal level if not consciously) to ⟮maintain the current -ism order⟯

##### details

###### culture

υ culture, where υ is an aspect of the - experience is the pervasiveness and normalization of υ.
υ culture often gives rise to victim-blaming.

similarly but slightly differently, ⟮Car culture⟯ (when it doesn't just mean ⟮an appreciation for cars⟯) refers to ⟮a culture/environment/society which is designed for and around cars.⟯

###### passing ＆ stealth

In a broad sense, a person that is passing is assumed to be part of a social group that they are not in fact a part of.
In a narrow sense, passing is being percieved as part of a + group though one is actually part of a - group.
To go/be/live stealth is to hide that one is the -value state of an ism, and especially that one is trans.
To ⟮out⟯ someone is to ⟮reveal that a person⟯ is ⟮a -value person of an ism⟯, generally ⟮without their consent⟯

###### covering

Covering is downplaying one's - identity by hiding or downplaying parts of the - identity.
The requirement to cover is not so much to hide one's - identity to make it as unobtrusive to people with + identities as possible, or to give people with + identities the least amount of opportunity to attack / sanction one.

###### victim-blaming

Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them.

###### depiction in media/discourse

####### death

Though it is not true for every ism, in generally characters with - identities are more likely to die, or die first.

ism|TVtropes trope|details
racism|Black Dude Dies First|(despite name, any non-white character)
sexism|Vasquez Always Dies|(mostly transgressive, 'masculine' women, despite the fact these should be more apt to survive (A/N: Really though? Masculinity is associated with unnecessary risk-taking etc.))
hetero ＆ cissexism|Bury Your Gays, Gay Guy Dies First
sexism|Slashers Prefer Blondes ＆ Final Girl|The blonde girl 'tainted by sexuality' dies first, while the final girl, who is 'pure' survies until the end.
ablism|Bury Your Disabled

####### evil

Any - identity has certain characteristics that 'explain' how they could easily become evil, hence villains tend to have one or more - identity. 
hetero/cissexism, ablism and sanism seem to produce - identity as villains especially frequently.


Sexism|"Woman as temptress"
Heterosexism|"Depraved Homosexual",
"Psycho Lesbian",
"Depraved Bisexual"
Ableism|"Evil Cripple"
Cissexism ＆ Sexism|"Sissy Villain", 
"Makeup Is Evil", 
"Creepy Crossdresser"
Sanism|Crazy Villain
Allosexism|"Villainous Aromantic Asexual"


###### chasers

A ⟮chaser⟯ ⟮fetishizes⟯ and thus ⟮pursues⟯ ⟮the - group of an ism⟯.˛ 

###### pick me

A pick me x (girl/gay/whatever) is a - person who tries to distinguish themselves from other - people by separating themselves from traits associated with - by treating those traits negatively, in order to gain approval from + people.

###### medical and social models

Many ⟮isms⟯ have ⟮a medical model⟯ and ⟮a social model⟯ of ⟮what it is to be a -value person⟯. 
The ⟮ social model⟯ of ⟮being a -ist⟯ argues that ⟮society creates the - and + identities⟯ from ⟮the way it's structured/its inherent problems⟯
The social model places the genesis of a - identity in society, the medical model in the individual.
The ⟮medical model⟯ of ⟮being a -value person⟯ argues that being a -ist is a natural feature.
The medical model of being a -value person argues one ⟮should aim to⟯ ⟮move from -value to +value⟯ if possible, if not, one should ⟮focus on⟯ ⟮seeming +value⟯, and if that's not possible, one should ⟮be erased⟯ (often via ⟮special institutions⟯).
For isms with a medical model, the negativity associated with having a - identity is institutionalized and thus 'objectified'/naturalized in the medical field.
Neurodiversity is an attempt to reframe the distinction between + and - identities (sane and insane) within sanism as a value-neutral distinction between human mental traits.


medical model of|natural features that give rise to - identies|attempts to flip - identities to + identities are based on
sanism|brain chemistry|pharmacological treatment
cissexism|Gender identity disorder (until the DSM-5)/gebder dysphoria|hormone therapy, gender conforming surgery.

#### violence

-ists suffer varied forms of structural and behavioral violence.

##### economics

###### pay gap

The ⟮x pay gap⟯ or ⟮x wage gap⟯ is the ⟮difference between the remuneration⟯ ⟮for - group and + group of an ism⟯ for ⟮work⟯. 
There are two forms of ⟮x pay/wage gap⟯, ⟮non-adjusted⟯ and ⟮adjusted.⟯ 
The ⟮non-adjusted⟯ ⟮pay gap⟯ {{c11::just takes into account the difference in average pay} 
The ⟮adjusted⟯ ⟮pay gap⟯ ⟮adjusts for factors such as employee's age, education level, years of work experience, occupation, industry, location, company and job title⟯ 
The pay gap that it was coined for was the ⟮gender pay gap⟯, there is however also ⟮strong evidence for pay gaps for other - groups,⟯ such as ⟮the race pay⟯ gap. 
For ⟮intersectional identities⟯, ⟮pay gaps⟯ can be ⟮stark indeed⟯, for example, ⟮black women⟯ are payed ⟮63 cents⟯ and ⟮latina women⟯ just ⟮55 cents⟯ (both ⟮non-adjusted) ⟯ for ⟮each dollar a white man makes.⟯ 

###### ceiling

the x ceiling is the unofficial/uncodified/'invisible' limit on career advancement that people with a certain - identity face.
heterosexism|lavender ceiling
sexism|glass ceiling
racism (asian-american)|bamboo ceiling
nativisim (refugees)|canvas ceiling
classism|class ceiling

Importantly, the cotton ceiling is the exclusion of trans people from consideration as sexual partners, not anything to do with employment.

####### cliff

the ⟮x cliff⟯ is the idea that even if ⟮people with a - identity⟯) ⟮s4;s5;⟮break through the glass ceiling⟯⟯, they are often given ⟮executive positions⟯ during ⟮periods of crisis/downturn⟯, where ⟮s5; ⟮the risk of failure is highest⟯, e.g. ⟮s6;c7;Ellen Pao at reddit, Thresa May after brexit.⟯⟯ 

####### statistics

female|5%
black|1%
gay|0.02%

#### resistance

For any ism, the dominant position is that -ists should stay invisible and quiet, to allow for erasure.
Thus, hegemonic -ity always includes not aiming to upset the status quo.

#### consciousness

We might say political consciousness is seeing/recognizing the relevant ism as structuring the world (at least in part), coming to realize your part in a community of -ists, and thus understanding ⟮problems⟯ and ⟮remedies⟯ in ⟮terms of political action⟯
ergo: race-consciousness → political consciosuness regarding racism etc.
false consciousness is the failure to gain political consciousness or to gain the wrong sort of political consciousness.
false consciousness happens due to all the ways the relative ism distorts thinking and seeing.
Marxism argues that without false consciousness (at least in the case of capitalism), the -ists would overthrow the +ists.

##### origin: class consciousness

⟮class consciousness⟯ (in a sort of general sense) is ⟮political consciousness⟯ (in the sense of ⟮seeing one's experience and struggle as part of a group⟯) of ⟮social classes⟯, and since it's a ⟮marxist⟯ term, esp. of ⟮the proletariat⟯ and ⟮the capitalists⟯. ⟮Class consciousness⟯ is the ⟮original⟯ term, is ⟮more common⟯ than ⟮political consciousness⟯ as a term, and is thus also ⟮often used as a synonym.⟯

## more than one identity

The kyriarchy is the -arch of multiple or all -archys at the same time.
within ⟮kyriarchy⟯ people may be ⟮both opressor and opressed⟯ at the same time or at different times. Originally but not always imagined as a ⟮pryramid⟯.

### intersectionality

⟮intersectionality⟯ considers ⟮social identities⟯ and concomittant ⟮oppression/domination⟯ and ⟮privilege⟯ in ⟮combination⟯, rather than ⟮considering each factor in isolation⟯. 
⟮Intersectionality⟯ was coined by ⟮Crenshaw⟯ in ⟮1989⟯ and started ⟮being popular as a framework⟯ in ⟮the early 2000s⟯ 
In 1989, Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term "⟮intersectionality⟯" in a paper as a way to help explain the ⟮oppression of African-American women⟯. She argues the experience of being a ⟮black woman⟯ ⟮cannot be understood⟯ in terms ⟮independent of either being black or a woman⟯. Rather, it must include ⟮interactions between the two identities⟯, which, she adds, frequently reinforce one another. 
⟮Tripple oppression⟯ is a term developed originally by ⟮black socialists in the US⟯, which refers to (in our modern terminolgy) ⟮the intersectional experience⟯ of ⟮black women⟯ at the nexus of ⟮classism, racism, and sexism⟯ 

### justification

Homonationalism is the phenomenon where some powers line up with the claims of the LGBT community in order to justify racist, nativist, etc. positions.

### racism

#### school to prison pipeline 

the ⟮school-to-prison pipeline⟯ in one definition is the ⟮disproportionate tendency⟯ of minors and young adults from ⟮disadvantaged backgrounds⟯ (generally ⟮race⟯-related) to ⟮become incarcerated⟯, often due to ⟮educational discrimination⟯. §
the ⟮school-to-prison pipeline⟯ may also reference the effects of ⟮a slew of policies⟯ to ⟮make school more 'tough on crime'/prison-like⟯. 
Often the ⟮school-to-prison pipeline⟯ refers to both ⟮the schools-as-prisons⟯ and ⟮the generally race-related educational discrimination⟯ that ⟮makes children more likely to end up in prison.⟯

### classism

A distinction of the ⟮poor⟯ that began with ⟮the poor laws in england in the 1600s⟯ (as far as I can tell) and we still have is that between the ⟮deserving⟯ ⟮poor⟯, generally characterized as ⟮somehow unable to work⟯ and thus ⟮not to be blamed⟯ for their ⟮poverty⟯, and ⟮undeserving⟯ ⟮poor⟯, which are characterized as ⟮those that could work but don't want to⟯ and thus ⟮are to be blamed⟯ for their ⟮poverty⟯

### (dis)ablism

#### inspiration porn

⟮Inspiration porn⟯ is the portrayal of ⟮people with disabilities⟯ as ⟮inspirational⟯ solely or in part on the basis ⟮of their disability⟯. We should probably consider it a form of ⟮(dis)ablism⟯.

### x work/x-al labor

⟮Hochschild⟯ coined the terms ⟮emotion work/emotional labor⟯. 
On ⟮the model of⟯ emotion work/emotional labor, other ⟮more or less common terms have been coined⟯. 
While ⟮some people⟯ treat ⟮emotion/x work and emotional/x-al labor⟯ as ⟮synonyms⟯, there is ⟮a clear distinction⟯. 

|value|example
⟮x work, e.g. emotion work⟯|⟮use value only⟯|⟮c+;s16:17;part of a job⟯
⟮x-al labor, e.g. emotional labor⟯|⟮use value and exchange value⟯|⟮c+;s19:20;in an intimate relationship⟯


type of work/labor|involves|example
⟮emotion work/emotional labor⟯|⟮managing our own emotions⟯ (Hochschild (complementary but not equivalent): "⟮creating a publically observable display⟯")|⟮c+;sb;a waiter gets insulted, goes through a ritual in his head and still appears friendly⟯
⟮empathy work/empathical labor⟯|⟮creating the feeling of being understood in others⟯
⟮conversation work/conversational labor⟯|⟮maintaining a conversation (if it has a purpose that both parties subscribe to⟯)|⟮c+;sb;a person tries hard to come up with relevant topics and questions during a date/a meeting with a long-lost relative⟯
⟮interpretion work/interpretive labor⟯|⟮modelling the others perspective⟯|⟮c+;sb;A person gets handed a form with an ambiguous question and tries to understand what the institution wants from them.⟯


The two strategies people use in performing ⟮emotion work/labor (not sure in how far it applies to the family of similar concepts⟯ are  ⟮surface acting and deep acting⟯ 
⟮emotion work/labor⟯ by ⟮getting into a state where one genuinely feels the emotions⟯ is called ⟮deep acting⟯ 
⟮emotion work/labor ⟯ by ⟮pretending, without changing how one actually feels⟯ is called ⟮surface acting⟯

### citation metrics

#### coupling ＆ co-citation

flex-container:✫Visualization_of_co-citation_analysis_methods.png✫

Bibliographic coupling measures how many of the same works two documents cite. 
If two documents cite at least one work in common, they are bibliographically coupled. 
The bibliographic coupling strength/index will be 3 if they cite 3 works in common.
Co-citation measures how frequently two documents are cited together by other documents. 
If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. 
The more co-citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength/index (e.g. co-cited by 3 works → co-citation strength of 3). It is supposed to predict how semantically-related they are.

## writing

### referencing

#### plagiarism

plagiarism is using someone else's intellectual/artistic products without proper attribution.

#### citation

##### content

Reference and citation are most often synonyms.
Citation is indicating a source of information.
A »full citation« fully identifies a source, and where in the source the information can be found, if applicable.
A »short citation« identifies a source in a short way and where in the source the information can be found, if applicable. to resolve a short citation to the actual work, finding the corresponding full citation is normally needed.
Philosophical works sometimes get an abbreviation such as KrV for use in short citations
A »complete citation« is the pair of a short citation and a full citation.
Author-date is a type of short citation where one includes the author and date.
Author-date citation is also called harvard style.

some citation styles allow using ibid. instead of the page information if the page information is repeated.

##### placement

onion-box:
citations 
  in-body citation 
    note citation
    in-text citation
  works cited/references entry


Note citations are citations in endnotes/footnotes.
In-text citations are citations within the flow of text.
Typically, short citations are also in-body citations, and full citations are reference entries.

##### → in-text short citations

Parenthetical citation is a type of in-text short citation format where the citation is surrounded in parentheses.
Narrative citation is a type of in-text short citation format where the citation is mentioned in the prose of the text.
Author-date/harvard style is often realized as narrative or parenthetical citations.
author-date-narrative-format ::= ‹author› \(‹date›\)
author-date-parenthetical-format ::= \(‹author› ‹date›[, ‹page-specifier›]\)

when adding page specifiers to author-date narrative citations, the page specifier goes in its own set of parentheses, at the end of the clause.

###### specifying pages

page-specifier ::= p. ‹integer›[f.|ff.|-‹integer›]

f.|this page or the next
ff.|this page or any following.

##### sections

＿Works Cited＿ and ＿References＿ are synonyms.
Sometimes the ＿References＿ section is also called 「reference list」
»Works Cited«/»References« are sections at the end of the work containing ＿full citations＿.
Properly, a »bibliography« should contain all works consulted, not those merely cited.
Often, 「bibliography」 is also just used as a synonym for ＿Works Cited＿/＿References＿.
A bibliography may also be a separate work listing works on a particular topic.
An annotated bibliography is a bibliography with author's comments on each work.
「Literaturverzeichnis」 is the german name for ＿Works Cited＿/＿References＿.
Quellenverzeichnis may be used as a synonym for Literaturverzeichnis, but is more properly a section used in historical science for identifying primary sources.

##### citation style

A citation style is a set of rules of how to structure your citations.
the APA is the american psychological association.
the APA publishes a style guide, which is often autohyponymously also called APA.
Of the APA style guide, the thing that is most well known is its citation style.
The current APA edition is the 7th, released 2019.

#### quotations

quotes are either direct or indirect
indirect quotation is a synonym for paraphrase
The primary/secondary and direct/indirect quotation distinctions are completely separate.
A primary quotation is from the work itself, a secondary quotation is via a third work, trusting that work to have faithfully reproduced the quote in the first place.

##### modifying

Within quotes, square brackets are used to modify quotes.

### structure

1. Title page
2. table of contents (optional)
3. abstract
4. main body

2. main section
3. schluss

The introduction often contains a motivation, context on the topic and pre-existing research, a hypothesis, possibly comments on the sources, as well as a short summary of the structure of the paper.
Der Schluss einer akademischen arbeit enthält normalerweise (wobei oft nicht getrennt) eine ⟮zusammenfassung⟯, ⟮konklusion⟯, und ⟮ausblick⟯.

##### hypothesis

### types of works

#### monographs

A monograph is typically a single work on a single subject by a single author.

### fear

#### exposure therapy

flex-container:✫sm_2021-10-31--17-32-33-screenshot.jpg✫
A ⟮fear ladder⟯ is a technique within ⟮exposure therapy⟯. 
For any specific ⟮fear/anxiety/phobia⟯, a ⟮fear ladder⟯ consists of ⟮specific situations/steps⟯ and ⟮their associated fear ratings⟯ 
⟮Fear ratings⟯ for fears on ⟮the fear ladder⟯ generally are on ⟮a scale from 1 to 10⟯ 
There should roughly be ⟮one situation/action⟯ on the fear ladder for ⟮each fear rating from 1 to 10⟯. 
A ⟮fear ladder⟯ should be applied ⟮regularly⟯ (e.g. ⟮s16;⟮daily, a few times a week⟯⟯ ). 
⟮Each session of the application of a fear ladder⟯ should last until ⟮the thing feels less anxiety-provoking::desired outcome?⟯ ( ⟮s19;⟮half⟯ is a good goal to short for⟯ ) (often ⟮30min +::length⟯ are necessary, ⟮relaxation excersizes such as breathing⟯ can help) 
⟮c+;Fear ladders ＆ exposure therapy⟯ work(s) because ⟮your anxiety basically "runs out of gas"⟯. For ⟮a fear ladder⟯, start with ⟮the lower items⟯ on ⟮the fear ladder,⟯ and ⟮work yourself up to the higher items⟯ as they ⟮become less frightening⟯.

### dreams

#### REM sleep ＆ lucid dreaming

REM|Rapid Eye Movement
⟮Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep⟯ is the time where ⟮one dreams the weird kind of dreams we call dreams⟯. 
The body is mostly ⟮paralyzed⟯ during ⟮REM sleep⟯, except for ⟮the eyes⟯. 
The fact that ⟮eye movement can be controlled during REM sleep⟯ allows ⟮study participants to communicate with researchers⟯ during ⟮lucid dreaming.⟯ 

the time that ⟮⁑intentional⁑ behaviour takes⟯ in ⟮dreams⟯ is ⟮about the same⟯ as in ⟮RL⟯ 


##### Testing if one is dreaming

Activity|How to check?|Positive result if
⟮jumping⟯|⟮jump up⟯|⟮if you float or levitate⟯

⟮magical powers⟯|⟮try and use them⟯|⟮if it works⟯


A ⟮lucid dream⟯ is one in which ⟮one is aware that one is dreaming⟯. 
⟮Often but not always⟯, ⟮lucid dreams⟯ allow ⟮some control over the events happneing in the dream⟯. 
Evidence for ⟮lucid dreams existing⟯ is ⟮quite strong.⟯ 

### perception

The rashomon effect is where eyewitnesses give contradictory descriptions of an event.

## neurodiversity

### OCD

OCD|Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
⟮OCD⟯ (at least using current definitions and stats) affects ⟮about 2%⟯ of people at ⟮some point in their life.⟯ 
⟮The onset⟯ of ⟮OCD⟯ is most commonly ⟮in late adolescense/early 20s.⟯
In general, ⟮OCD⟯ mainly consists of ⟮obsessions⟯ and {{c-::compulsions}}
⟮Obsessions⟯ are ⟮intrusive = non-voluntary⟯, ⟮disturbing/uncomfortable/scary⟯ ⟮thoughts⟯. 
⟮Compulsions⟯ are ⟮the acts performed⟯ to ⟮soothe the obsessions⟯. 
People generally carry out their ⟮compulsions⟯ in a ⟮very structured⟯ manner. 
People suffering from OCD generally ⟮do not want to⟯ ⟮perform the compulsions⟯, ⟮but the discomfort of the compulsion and the need to get relief is often stronger⟯.
If acute, compulsions may take up ⟮a hour or more⟯ of the day.
OCD-like thoughts are ⟮common for everyone⟯, the question is ⟮the severity⟯. 
The ⟮most common type⟯ of ⟮OCD obsession⟯ is ⟮fears related to contamination (e.g. dirt, germs, viruses, chemicals⟯). 
Sometimes ⟮the obsession will become less important over time⟯, and ⟮the compusion will be carried out more as a habit⟯.

#### Strategy to get people to understand OCD

1. ⟮Ask relevant person to agree with a statement that saying something or thinking something doesn’t mean it will come true, that our thoughts are not magical and can’t make things happen⟯
2. ⟮c+;s1;Have them write down something terrible happen to a loved one⟯
3. ⟮c+;s∞;Have them notice the distress they feel at something that will not do anything⟯

## motivation

### learned helplessness

In aquiring ⟮learned helplessness⟯, agents are exposed to ⟮an averse stimulus⟯ that ⟮they cannot control/avoid⟯ ⟮repeatedly⟯ 
With ⟮learned helplessness⟯, agents fail to f⟮ail to avoid the thingy⟯ after ⟮being exposed to an unavoidable averse stimulus⟯, even when ⟮they have control again (and this is indicated clearly⟯) 
In fact, in contrast to the ⟮original idea of learned helplessness⟯, it seems that ⟮passivity is the default reaction⟯ and ⟮'helpfulness' is learned⟯ 
The ⟮original⟯ ⟮learned helplessness⟯ ⟮experiment⟯ featured ⟮shocking dogs⟯ ⟮without them being able to do anything about it.⟯ 
In ⟮the original learned helplessness experiment⟯, one needed to ⟮physically show the dogs (by moving their limbs⟯) ⟮how to escape the shocks⟯ ⟮at least twice⟯ so ⟮they would relearn that they had control⟯ 
The ⟮noise experiment⟯ is related to ⟮learned helplessness⟯ 
⟮c+;Hiroto, D.S.; Seligman, M.E.P.⟯ ⟮(c:37;1975⟯), subjects were supposed to ⟮do mental tasks⟯ while ⟮a distracting sound played⟯. ⟮hb;⟮One experimental group⟯ ⟮could (or thought they could) turn it off⟯, and ⟮the other⟯ ⟮couldn't⟯. ⟮hb;⟮The ones that could turn of the noise⟯ ⟮did better on the task⟯ ⟮even if they didn't turn it off.⟯⟯⟯ 
⟮Self-efficacy⟯ is ⟮(The strength of) one's belief⟯ in ⟮one's own ability⟯ to ⟮complete asks in order to reach a goal⟯ 
⟮Veritasium⟯ argues students/employees will ⟮try their best(based on what they know⟯) when ⟮given a task⟯, but ⟮if they hit a roadblock⟯, they ⟮won't try anything else (but just ask the supervisor⟯) - even though t⟮hey could have probably figured out methods to overcome a roadblock⟯ - reflecting, according to Veritasium, ⟮learned helplessness⟯ 
Veritasium argues besides the pracitcal reasons of connection and resources etc, ⟮self-efficacy⟯ is part of the reason ⟮children of people with a certain career take up that career.⟯ 

## relationships

### gaslighting

We get the term ⟮gaslighting⟯ from ⟮the 1940s film Gaslight⟯ 
In the film ⟮Gaslight⟯, the protagonist ⟮claims the gas lights were not dimmed⟯ after ⟮dimming them himself.⟯ 
⟮The protagonists goal⟯ in the film ⟮gaslight⟯ is ⟮to have his wife declared insane⟯. 
⟮Gaslighting⟯ is a form of ⟮manipulation⟯. 
The effect of (successful) ⟮gaslighting⟯ is that the victim ⟮can no longer determine⟯ /⟮is mislead about⟯ ⟮the trut⟯h, or that they ⟮can no longer tell⟯ ⟮right⟯ from ⟮wrong⟯, ⟮beneficial⟯ from ⟮harmful⟯. 
For example, someone ⟮gaslighting⟯ may deny that ⟮past events⟯ ⟮have happen⟯, and thus ⟮make the gaslit person question if they actually have⟯. 
For example, someone ⟮gaslighting⟯ may ⟮make fun of someones needs⟯, and thus ⟮make them question if their needs are actually legitimate⟯. 
⟮Gaslighting⟯ may be ⟮intentional⟯ or ⟮unintentional⟯, and may be more often used by ⟮narcissists / sociopaths⟯. 
⟮Gaslighting⟯ can occur in ⟮any personal relationship⟯, we may also want to ⟮extend the definition to a societal level⟯. 

### abuse

The ⟮cycle of abuse⟯ is a ⟮common pattern⟯ for ⟮abusive relationships⟯. 
The ⟮Cycle of abuse⟯: ⟮Tension building⟯ → ⟮Acute explosion/Incident⟯ → ⟮Honeymoon⟯ (repeat) 

### dark triad

#### narcissism

⟮»Narcissists«⟯ have an overriding desire to ⟮protect/soothe/strengthen⟯ their ⟮self-image.⟯ 
⟮»Narcisstic supply«⟯ are ⟮the doses of admiration, validation, approval, respect, attention, subservience⟯ that ⟮a narcisst seeks to soothe their self-image.⟯ 
»⟮Narcisstic injury⟯« is ⟮damage⟯ that a narcisst takes ⟮to their self-image.⟯ 

In ⟮a family with a narcissist⟯, people end up ⟮being forced into roles⟯ - ⟮the whole construct⟯ is called the »⟮narcissistic family⟯«. 
⟮The narcisstic family⟯'s ⟮roles⟯ are ⟮structural⟯: ⟮The relationships between roles is what creates the structure, and makes it resilient to change.⟯ 
⟮The narcissistic family⟯ consists of different ⟮roles⟯: ⟮the narcissist⟯, ⟮the golden child⟯ and ⟮the scapegoat⟯ ⟮establish the structure⟯, butressed by ⟮flying monkeys⟯, ⟮neutral siblings/people.⟯ and sometimes also others (e.g. enablers)
⟮Roles⟯ in a ⟮narcissistic family⟯ may ⟮shift⟯ if ⟮they do not provide the function to the narcissist anymore.⟯ 

In a narcissistic family the ⟮»golden child«⟯ is the person ⟮onto which the narcissist projects⟯ what ⟮they want to believe about themselves.⟯ 
The ⟮golden child⟯ ⟮strengthens the narcissists self-image⟯ by ⟮projection⟯. 
The ⟮golden child⟯'s ⟮achievements⟯ are ⟮highly rewarded⟯. 

In a narcissistic family, the »⟮scapegoat⟯« is the person ⟮onto which the narcissist projects⟯ what t⟮hey don't want to believe about themselves.⟯ 
The ⟮scapegoat⟯ ⟮strengthens the narcissists self-image⟯ by ⟮contrast⟯. 
The ⟮scapegoat⟯'s ⟮achievements⟯ are ⟮not acknowledged⟯, and may ⟮even surreptitiosuly be punished⟯. 
Conversely, the ⟮scapegoat⟯'s ⟮failures⟯ may be ⟮rewarded⟯. 
However, the scapegoat may have an easier time ⟮breaking away from the narcisstic family structure⟯. 

In a narcisstic family, the ⟮»neutral sibling/person«⟯ is said to be the sibling/person that ⟮always tries to mediate⟯, but ends up ⟮denying the reality of what's happening⟯. 
In a narcisstic family, a »⟮flying monkey⟯« is person ⟮used by the narcissist⟯ as ⟮a proxy for their narcissist actions.⟯

# lock-picking

## lockpicking tools

In general, the three major types of lockpicking tools are ⟮hooks⟯, ⟮rakes⟯, and ⟮tensioning tools⟯. 

## basic lock model

flex-container:✫sm_Simple-Paper-Lock-Lock-Picking-Theory.gif✫✫sm_Shear-Line-Lock-Picking-Theory.png✫
We can construct a basic sort of lock with ⟮a pencil⟯ and ⟮two pieces of paper.⟯ 
The ⟮gap between the two pieces of paper⟯ is ⟮the shear line⟯, and ⟮the pencil⟯ is ⟮the pin⟯. 

## lock externals

Everything else in a ⟮cylinder lock⟯ is ⟮contained in⟯ ⟮the cylinder(shell/casing/housing/body) ⟯ 
If we were to ⟮cut apart an average door in europe or the US⟯ and ⟮take the locking mechanism out⟯, we would be seeing ⟮the cylinder (shell/casing/housing/body⟯).

The ⟮cylinder⟯ of a lock is also called ⟮shell/housing/casing/body⟯. 
⟮A lock that is contained in a cylinder⟯ is known as ⟮a cylinder lock⟯. 
⟮Cylinder locks⟯ are i⟮ndependent from the boltwork⟯, and so ⟮allow easy maintenance⟯. 
⟮Pin tumbler locks⟯ are the most common type of ⟮mechanism⟯ for ⟮cylinder locks⟯. 
⟮A pin tumbler lock⟯ uses ⟮pins⟯ ⟮contained in a tumbler⟯ to ⟮prevent locks from opening⟯. 
⟮Pin tumbler locks⟯ are the ones we think of when we think of ⟮locks and lock-picking⟯.

## comb picks

flex-container:✫sm_200px-Pin_tumbler_bypass.svg.png✫✫sm_300px-Lockpicking_Comb_Picks.jpg✫


Some insecure locks allow us to unlock them by ⟮ pushing both key and driver pins ⟯ ⟮past the shear line⟯ 
⟮comb picks⟯ ⟮push⟯ ⟮both driver and key pins⟯ ⟮completely into the lock⟯ 
comb picks might look like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
What normally ⟮prevents us from just pushing all pins completely above the shear line w/ comb picks⟯ is ⟮that there isn't enough space in the lock⟯ 

## shear line

The ⟮shear line⟯ is ⟮the gap between⟯ ⟮the casing⟯ and ⟮the plug⟯ 
⟮the driver pins⟯ are the pins that ⟮the springs are directly contactin⟯g 
⟮the key pins⟯ are the pins that ⟮the key will directly contact⟯ and that ⟮thus 'read' the key⟯ 
To ⟮open a door⟯, ⟮the plug⟯ ⟮must be able to rotate⟯. 
If a door is ⟮locked⟯, ⟮the pins⟯ are ⟮preventing the plug from rotating⟯. 
For the ⟮plug to be able to rotate⟯, ⟮the gaps between pins⟯ must ⟮line up with the shear line.⟯ 
If ⟮the correct key is inserted⟯, it makes ⟮the gaps between pins⟯ ⟮line up with the shear line⟯. 
To ⟮prevent any old key to be used to open a lock⟯, ⟮the key pins have different lengths⟯ 
If you ⟮insert the wrong key into a lock⟯, the lock will not open because ⟮gaps between pins not in line with shear line⟯ 
The part of the lock that we are exploiting to pick is ⟮the shear line⟯ 
The thing that ⟮keeps the pins down in a lock⟯ are ⟮the springs⟯.

In a general sense, locks would ⟮not be pickable⟯ if not for ⟮manufacturing tolerances⟯. 
The reason that ⟮not all pins bind⟯ once you ⟮apply rotational tension⟯ is tha⟮t the holes are ever-so-slightly off-center⟯. 
The pin that will ⟮bind here first⟯ if we ⟮rotate in the upwards direction⟯ is ⟮the second or the fourth pin.⟯ 

## binding pins

flex-container:✫sm_Setting-Standard-Pin-Lock-Picking-Theory-.gif✫✫sm_Lock-Picking-Single-Pin-Picking.gif✫✫sm_Peterson-GSP-Hook-1-Black-Handle.jpg✫
A ⟮bound⟯ pin is the one that if ⟮rotational tension is being applied⟯ is ⟮hard to move (won't slip⟯) 
⟮Applying rotational tension⟯ allows ⟮pins⟯ to ⟮bind⟯, and thus ⟮setting them⟯. 
Pins can only ⟮bind⟯ if ⟮rotational tension is being applied⟯, otherwise ⟮they won't get stuck⟯ and f⟮all right back into the cylinder.⟯ 
There is ⟮most often (though not always⟯) ⟮only one⟯ ⟮binding pin⟯ at a time. 
The ⟮binding pin⟯ is ⟮the pin⟯ that ⟮is currently being bound⟯ (or ⟮will be bound once rotational tension is applied⟯), and thus is ⟮the next pin that can be set.⟯

⟮Single pin picking⟯ is ⟮picking the pins one at a time⟯, which looks something like ⟮‹image above›⟯ 
⟮Single pin picking⟯ uses ⟮hooks⟯ as tools, which look something like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
Core loop of ⟮single pin picking⟯: ⟮find binding pin⟯ → ⟮set binding pin⟯ 
To ⟮test if⟯ ⟮sth is a binding pin⟯, you ⟮push it slightly⟯. 
Compared to ⟮non-binding pins⟯, if we push on ⟮the binding pin⟯, it will feel ⟮slightly stiffer and harder to lift⟯. 
T⟮o set the binding pin⟯, we ⟮push on the pin⟯ until ⟮we reach the shear line⟯. 
Once ⟮you've pushed the binding pin to the shear line⟯, if ⟮you've set the pin⟯, ⟮the driver pin will catch⟯ and t⟮he key pin will fall into the plug⟯. 
Once ⟮you've pushed the binding pin to the shear line⟯, if y⟮ou've set the pin⟯, you probably hear ⟮a slight click⟯ or feel ⟮a slight rotation⟯. 
However, it is also possible to
⟮push the binding pin in too far⟯|⟮overset⟯|⟮✫sm_overset_1130.jpg✫⟯
⟮not push the binding pin in far enough⟯|⟮underset⟯|⟮✫sm_underset_1130.jpg✫⟯

If you ⟮can no longer find a binding pin⟯, you have likely ⟮overset or underset a pin⟯ 

## tensioning

flex-container:✫sm_standard-tension-wrench.jpg✫


⟮tensioning tools⟯ are for ⟮applying tension to the lock (to bind the pins⟯) 
The ⟮tension wrench⟯ is ⟮the most common type of⟯ ⟮tensioning tool.⟯ 
A tension wrench might look like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
A ⟮tension wrench⟯ has ⟮a short end⟯ to ⟮place in the keyway⟯ and ⟮a long end⟯ to ⟮act as a lever⟯. 
You need to apply ⟮very little tension⟯ with ⟮the tension wrench⟯ to bind the pins. 
⟮Letting go of the tension applied with the tension wrench⟯ ⟮resets the lock⟯. 

## raking

⟮Raking⟯ is ⟮scrubbing the pins⟯ until we ⟮happen to set all the pins⟯. 
Raking might look like ⟮‹image›⟯ 
⟮Raking⟯ has roughly the same motion as ⟮brushing your teeth⟯. 
In raking, we ⟮add tension⟯ and then ⟮scrub the pins⟯. 
In raking, while ⟮scrubbing the pins⟯, ⟮vary⟯ things like ⟮speed, tension, angle, height, etc⟯ ⟮slightly⟯. 
In raking, we ⟮reset the lock⟯ by ⟮removing tension.⟯ 
In ⟮raking⟯, we often have to ⟮reset the lock a few times⟯ before it works 
⟮Raking⟯ has the main advantage of ⟮being fast (to open the lock⟯), but the disadvantage of ⟮not working well for more difficult locks⟯. 
⟮Raking⟯ uses ⟮rakes⟯ as tools, which look like ⟮‹image›⟯
