S ::= {<statement>}
statement ::= <ruleset>|<at-rule>
ruleset ::= <selector-list><declaration-block>
rulesets are less properly but more commonly called rules
selector-group ::= <selector>{,<selector>}
declaration-block ::= \{{<declaration>}\}
declaration :: <property>:<value>; // Technically, the ; is not a part of the declaration, since it only separates and does not terminate declarations. Therefore you can leave out the final semicolon of a declaration block, though this is generally not advised. This would overcomplicate the ENBF, so here this note.

at-rule ::= @<identifier> <prelude>[\{<block>\}]
At rules that have the optional block are known as nested at-rules.
the block that an at-rule may take is explicitly specified by the spec not to be the same as the declaration block of a ruleset, and therefore not at all subject to the same syntax. Nested at-rules may however *choose to* follow the same syntax as a declaration block.
nested at-rules whose block is a declaration block: @counter-style, @font-face
nested at-rules whose block is a declaration block, but also supports other at-rules within: @page
nested at-rules whose block is not a declaration block: @keyframes, @media, @supports.
A nested statement is a statement that can be used inside a conditional group rule.
A conditional group rules is a CSS at-rule that associates a condition with a group of other CSS rules.
The commmon conditional group at rules are @media and @supports.

## Selectors

A selector is a generic term that can refer to simple selector, compound selector, complex selector, or selector list.
A simple selector is a single condition on an element.
A type selector, universal selector, attribute selector, class selector, ID selector, or pseudo-class (pseudo-element is missing from the documentation, but I presume is part of this to) is a simple selector.
A compound selectior is a sequence of one or more simple selectors that are not separated, and represent a set of simultaneous conditions on a single element.
If a compound selector contains a type selector or universal selector, that must come first.
A combinatior is a condition of the relationship between two compound selectors.
A complex selector is a sequence of compound selectors separated by combinators.
A complex selector represents a set of simultaneous conditions on element which are in the relationship described by the combinatiors.
A selector list is a list of any or multiple types of selectors, separated by commas.
A selector list most often means a list of complex selectors.
A selector list is also called called selector group.

selector-list (default complex selector meaning) ::= <complex-selector>{,<complex-selector>}
complex-selector ::= <compound-selector>{[<combinator>]<compound-selector>}
compound-selector ::= <simple-selector>{<simple-selector>}
simple-selector ::= <type-selector>||<universal-selector>||<attribute-selector>||<class-selector>||<id-selector>||<pseudo-class-selector>||<pseudo-element-selector>

### Selectors

#### Simple selectors



##### Basic types

Syntax of universal selector ::= *
the universal selector matches everything
Syntax of type selector ::= <name>
the type selector matches any element with the given nodename (so foo will match any <foo>)
Syntax of class selector ::= .<name>
The class selector matches any element with the given class
Syntax of id selector ::= #<name>
The id selector matches any element with the given ID
The attribute selector matches any element where a certain attribute is a certain way.
Syntax of attribute selector ::= \[<attr>[<operator><alue>]\]
no operator (and no value) [<attr>]|just elements with attribute present
= [attr=value]|attr is exactly value


Adding an i (or I) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).

##### Pseudo-classes

A pseudo-class indicates a state of an element
A pseudo-class is begun by a single colon

:empty| matches an element that has no child **nodes** (including text nodes)
:not(<selector-list>) matches elements that don't match selector-list.
:not() is a pseudo-class, but has no influence on specificity
:root selects the root element
:indeterminate selects indeterminate element.
An 
input type="checkbox"|indeterminate when its indeterminate property is set to true via JS
input type="radio"|indeterminate when no radio buttons with the same name are selected
progress|indeterminate when no value attribute is present.
:placeholder-shown selects an element whose placeholder is being shown (NOT the placeholder itself)

##### Pseudo-elements

A pseudo-element indicates a part of a element which isn't a real element.
A pseudo-element is begun by two colons

::after, ::before
In CSS, ::before/::after creates a pseudo-element that is the first/last child of the selected element. 
content can only be usefully be used on ::after and ::before
content syntax: normal|none|({<content-specifier>} / <alt-text>)
the content-specifier can be a bunch of different things

::placeholder|matches placeholder text
In HTML/CSS, <input> and <textarea> can have placeholder text in form of a placeholder attribute.
::selection|matches text currently selected/highlighted by the user via cursor/touch etc.
::selection only supports a subset of properties, mainly color, background-color and text-shadow.
::first-letter"matches the first letter of a block-level element
::first-line|matches the first line of a block-level element
::backdrop is the pseudo-element that is the size of the viewport and is rendered beneath {{c1::any element that is in fullscreen}}


#### Combinators

#### The Grouping selector


### 'Power'

#### Source type

#### Specificity

Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.
Specificity is beaten by source type.
Specificity is tiered. 
Each specifier on a tier gains you one point on the specificity scale.

3rd lowest|id selectors
2nd lowest|class selectors|attribute selectors|pseudo-class selectors
lowest|element selectors|pseudo-element selectors

## Declarations

### Properites and Values

#### inherited, initial, etc.

any property is inherited or not in its behavior when no value is assigned
inherited properties default to inheriting
non-inherited properties default to the initial value
some initial values are unintuitive, since we rarely see them, as they are typically overwritten by UA stylesheets
On the root element, even inherited properties recieve their initial values if not otherwise specified.
Keyword inherit/initial to force the inherited/initial value.
unset: choose between inherit and initial based on if the thing is inherited or non-inherited

#### css variables

Declaration: --var-name: value;
Accessing: var(--var-name)

#### Props

##### filters

backdrop-filter applies a filter to the area behind an element.
for backdrop-filter to apply, the element or its background must be at least partially transparent.
backdrop-filter and filter take a <filter-function-list>
filter-function-list ::= <filter-function>|<svg-filter>{ <filter-function>|<url>} # the URL is for a svg filter
a <filter-function> is a <function> that applies a filter (i.e. changes the appearance of an image)
filter-functions: 
blur(): takes a blur-radius
brightness(): <number-or-percentage-to-infinity>
contrast(): <number-or-percentage-to-infinity>
drop-shadow(): arguments are <code>offset-x offset-y [blur-radius] [color]</code>
grayscale(): <number-or-percentage-0-1>
hue-rotate(): takes an <angle> and rotates the hue by that angle
invert(): <number-or-percentage-0-1>
opacity(): <number-or-percentage-0-1>
saturate(): <number-or-percentage-to-infinity>
sepia(): <number-or-percentage-0-1>

anywhere that takes a blur-radius generally takes a <length> which defines the standard deviation of the gaussian function

There are a few places which accept a <number> or <percentage>. This is not an official CSS data type, but I will call this <number-or-percentage>.
There are a few different sets of semantics for <number-or-percentage>
<number-or-percentage-to-infinity>: 0/0% is the opposite effect (complete lack of x), 1/100% is original, 2/200% is 2x the effect
<number-or-percentage-0-1>: 0/0% is complete lack, 1/100% is complete application

##### Cursor

`cursor` sets how the cursor looks when mousing over (generally irrelevant for touchscreens).
`cursor` value syntax {<url> <x> <y>,} <keyword>
When specifying an url() for cursor, the x and y values specify the offset in px of the hotspot of the cursor
`cursor: none` hides the cursor.
`cursor: default` shows the platform-default cursor.
Other <keyword>s for `cursor` (non-exhaustive, as there are ~40) are wait, crosshair, not-allowed, zoom, copy, grab.

##### word-break, overflow-wrap

##### width, height

width and height each have corresponding min- and max- properties
power of width and height properties: min- > max- > ø
width and height and corresponding min/max values take the following values: <length-percentage>|auto|min-content|max-content|fit-content(<length-percentage>)

##### flexbox & grid

Flex or grid containers are declared by setting display to flex/inline-flex or grid/inline-grid.
The thing that has display:flex/inline-flex/grid/inline-grid is called flex/grid container.

##### Orphans and Widows

orphans and widows are two twin properties in CSS that apply only to pages or columns.
Both orphans and widows take an <integer>
orphans says how many lines of a block container must appear at the bottom of a page/column if it is broken over two pages/columns
widows says how many lines of a block container must appear at the top of a page/column if it is broken over two pages/columns

##### Text

The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized. It also can help improve legibility for ruby.
the color keyword sets the color of the text and text decorations and accpets a <color> value.

word-spacing sets the additional space between words beyond the space there by default. 
word-spacing takes a <length-percentage>

##### Scrolling

overscrolling is what happens when you scroll further on something than that thing allows.
on mobile browsers and some desktop browsers, there is a form of overscrolling where the site will rubberband
when you overscroll a container, and this then starts scrolling the next-higher container, this is known as scroll chaining.
overscroll-behavior is actually a shorthand for overscroll-behavior-x and overscroll-behavior-y
overscroll-behavior: none prevents all overscrolling.
overscroll-behavior: contain will prevent scroll chaining only

##### float & clear

float places an element at one side of the container or next to another floating element, allowing text/inline elements to wrap around it.
float: left/right makes the element go to the left/right side of the container/the next float respectively.
A floating element is where the (computed) value of float is not none.
Float implies display: block, and converts it if required.
The clear CSS property sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared) floating elements that precede it. 
the clear property applies to clearing all floats if set to both, or to only clearing left/right floats if set to left or right.
If element contains only floated elements, its height will collapse to nothing.
To prevent and element containing only floated elements height collapsing to nothing, a technique called a clearfix is used.
The most common clearfix technique might be: ::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}

##### display

The display property controls two distinct-things: the outer and the inner display type.
The outer display type of an element controls how it will praticipate in normal flow.
The inner display type of an element controls the layout of the children.
There is a two-value syntax for display describing the outer and inner display type separately, but it isn't well supported yet.
The two-value syntax for display is <display-outside> <display-inside>
In absence of the two-value syntax for display, most keywords control both the outer and the inner display type.
The possible values for <display-outside> are the ways an element can participate in normal flow.
There are two ways an element can participate in normal flow, block and inline.
Some values for display do not set the outer or inner display type, instead they set a role within a complex layout model.
The values for display that don't set the outer or inner display type, but instead their role within a complex layout have the type <display-internal>.
The complex layout models that have display properties for their parts are table and ruby.
the values with type <display-internal> are ruby-* and table-*

legacy-1-value property|equivalent
inline-block|inline flow-root
inline-table|inline table
inline-flex|inline flex
inline-grid|inline grid

Everything in CSS is within a certain formatting context.
The best way of thinking of formatting contexts is as mini-layouts
Most <display-inside> values establish a new formatting context, besides flow, which may not.
The purpose of <display-inside> is to set new formatting contexts, unless we're using flow for compat.
<display-inside>|establishes formatting context
flow-root|block formatting context
table|table formatting context
ruby|ruby formatting context
grid|grid formatting context
flex|flex formatting context

If only the <display-inside> value is set, the <display-outside> value will default to block.

the value flow for <display-inside> makes the element participate in normal/flow layout as normal.
if only <display-outside> is specified, <display-inside> will be set to flow for compatibility;

display: list-item may be either a <display-outside> or a <display-inside> value.
display: list-item may be combined with block/inline for <display-outside> and flow/flow-root for <display-inside>

Elements within a block-formatting context are layed out according to normal flow.
Normal flow may also be called flow layout.
a block-formatting context, by establishing a new flow layout, has interesting effects.
- they contain floats 
the <html> element establishes a new block-formatting context.
Block-formatting contexts are created explicitly with the <display-inside> value of flow-root.
Block-formatting contexts are also created by a bunch of other properties, including but possibly not limited to:
floating elements
flex and grid items.
elements with...
column-span: all
contain: layout|content|strict
overflow: anything but vissible
display: table-cell
absolutely positioned elements

a block-level element is an element with <display-outside> block
a inline-level element is an element with <display-outside> inline
Normal flow has two basic parameters: the <dfn>inline (base) direction</dfn> and the <dfn>block (flow) direction</dfn>.
The inline base direction defines how content is ordered inline.
The block flow direction defines how blocks are added.
Generally, the inline base direction and block flow direction are perpendicular to one another.
The inline base direction and block flow direction are mainly determined by writing-mode.
any value for writing mode has the syntax (vertical|horizontal)-(lr|rl|tb).
The default value for writing-mode (horizontal-tb) has a inline base direction of horizontal, and a block flow direction of top to bottom.
By default, block-level elements are 100% width of the inline base direction axis.
block-level elements can have their height and width set manually, while inline-level elements
both inline-level andblock-level elements can have all their margins, borders and paddings set. however inline-level elements will only move other elements on the the inline base direction axis (i.e. not vertically for horizontal-tb).
<img src="sm_inline_margins.png">
Since inline-level elements don't have block flow direction margins, they can't suffer from margine collapsing.
inline-level elements and text nodes are actually handled by the browser via line boxes.
the browser will fill a line box in the inline base direction with inline-level elements or text until it is full
Once a line box is full, the browser will add a second line box, etc.
A line box is as tall as its tallest content.
If the browser encounters a block-level element while creating line boxes, it stops the line box, puts the block-level element on a line of itself, and then creates a new line box if there's more inline-level elements/text to be handled.
line-height sets the minimum height of a line box.
If we set the line height of multiple things in the same line box to different values, they may overflow into each others boxes.
<img src="sm_line_height_overflow.png">
vertical-align is relative to the line box for some properties, and to the font for others.

if writing-mode is vertical-??, the text-orientation property controls the rotation of the glyphs.
mixed|rotate vertical scripts (e.g. japanese), but not non-vertical scripts (e.g. latin letters)
upright|rotate all scripts
sideways|don't rotate any scripts (not well supported atm)

##### Background

The background: property is a shorthand for {{c1::background-clip}}, {{c2::background-color}}, {{c3::background-image}}, {{c4::background-origin}}, {{c5::background-position}}, {{c6::background-repeat}}, {{c7::background-size}} and {{c8::background-attachment}}
background-repeat may take a single value, which will specify both x and y, or two values, which apply to x and y respectively.
while single values for background-repeat generally specify both x and y, there are the single values repeat-x and repeat-y that will only repeat in the specified ways.
repeat|repeat as much as needed to cover the whole painting area, clipping if necessary
space|The image is repeated as much as possible without clipping. The first and last images are pinned to either side of the element, and whitespace is distributed evenly between the images. 
round|As the allowed space increases in size, the repeated images will stretch (leaving no gaps) until there is room (space left >= half of the image width) for another one to be added. When the next image is added, all of the current ones compress to allow room. 
no-repeat|do not repeat
background-color: <color>
background-color is rendered behind background-image

background-size poss vals
background-origin

background-attachment specifies how the background interacts with scrolling (it has a bunch of keyword values that I can't remember)
background-position takes a <position> value to position the background.

##### edges

Shorthand for edges in CSS use a consistent syntax:

1 value|specifies all sides|<img src="sm_1_border.png">
2 values|1st specifies top/bottom, 2nd specifies left/right|<img src="sm_2_border.png">
3 values|1st specfies top, 2nd specfies left/right, 3rd specifies|<img src="sm_3_border.png">
4 values|1,2,3,4 top right bottom left (TRBL)|<img src="sm_4_border.png">

Normally, instead of using the shorthand, you can also set the properties individually by using -top(-), -left(-), -bottom(-), -right(-) properties.

###### Border

border can also be seen as a shorthand for border-top, border-right...
border-width, border-style, border-color are all shorthand for edges, and can be set via the 4 properties individually.

##### lines

Line is not really an official css term.
Lines: border, column-rule

Lines have following shorthand and respective subproperties:
foo: foo-width || foo-style || foo-color

where foo-width takes a <line-width>
line-width ::= thin|medium|thick|<length>
where foo-style takes a <line-style>

line-style
hidden|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em hidden black;">&nbsp;</div>
dotted|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em dotted black;">&nbsp;</div>
dashed|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em dashed black;">&nbsp;</div>
solid|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em solid black;">&nbsp;</div>
double|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em double black;">&nbsp;</div>
groove|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em groove black;">&nbsp;</div>
ridge|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em ridge black;">&nbsp;</div>
inset|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em inset black;">&nbsp;</div>
outset|<div style="width: 10ch; height: 0.5em; border-bottom: 0.2em outset black;">&nbsp;</div>

##### Corners

1 value|specifies all sides|<img src="sm_1_corner.png">
2 values|1st specifies top/bottom, 2nd specifies left/right|<img src="sm_2_corner.png">
3 values|1st specfies top, 2nd specfies left/right, 3rd specifies|<img src="sm_3_corner.png">
4 values|1,2,3,4 top right bottom left (TRBL)|<img src="sm_4_corner.png">

##### Custom Counting

counter-reset and counter-increment and the css functions counter() and counters() are used to defined custom counters for counting().
counter-reset assigns a counter of name to value.
counter-reset defaults a counter to 0 if no value is specified.
counter-reset is also used initialize a counter.
counter-reset: <counter-name> [<value>]{,<counter-name> [<value>]}
counter-increment: <counter-name> [<value>]{<counter-name> [<value>]}
counter-increment: increments the counter by value (default 1) for each time it is encountered.
counter-reset on descendants creates a new counter, instead of assigning to the original counter.
The css functions counter() and counters() takes a necessary first argument of the name of the counter. 
The css functions counter() and counters() take an optional final argument of <counter-style>, which takes values of the css types <list-style-type>, <@counter-style> (or the ill-defined symbols function).
counters() differs from counter() in that it takes a middle argument of a string, and separates multiple instances of the counter with the given string.

<pre><code>ol {
  counter-reset: section;                /* Creates a new instance of the
                                            section counter with each ol
                                            element */
  list-style-type: none;
}

li::before {
  counter-increment: section;            /* Increments only this instance
                                            of the section counter */
  content: counters(section, ".") " ";   /* Combines the values of all instances
                                            of the section counter, separated
                                            by a period */
}</code></pre>

<pre><code><ol>
  <li>item</li>          <!-- 1     -->
  <li>item               <!-- 2     -->
    <ol>
      <li>item</li>      <!-- 2.1   -->
      <li>item</li>      <!-- 2.2   -->

</ol></code></pre>

#### Values

##### Functions

CSS functional notation is a type of CSS value that can represent more complex data types or invoke special data processing or calculations.
The syntax of CSS functional notation is: <name>\([<argument> {(,| ) <argument>}]\)

url()

##### offsets

generally from the top left corner

###### position

<position> can take two kinds of values: keywords and values.
Keywords for <position> are center, top, right, bottom and left.
A value for <postion> can be a <percentage> or <length>.
For <position>, specifying one value positions it exactly at that keyword (if keyword), or at value on the x axis and the y defaults to 50%.
For <position>, specifying two values means that the first will apply to x positioning, and the second will apply to y positioning, unless it is two keywords.
For <position>, a keyword followed by a value specifies the offset from the keyword.
For <position>, if specifying two keywords or two keywords with values each, the order doesn't matter.
The value described by <position> need not be inside the elements box.

<img src="sm_position_value.png">

##### color

All css color keywords are case-insensitive.
any property ending in -color: takes a <color> value
color  ::= transparent|currentColor|<color-keyword>|<hex-color>|<color-function>
color keywords are things such as red, darkgrey, rebeccapurple 💜, which correspond to specific RGB values.
the transparent keyword is a shortcut for rgba(0,0,0,0)
The currentColor keyword represents the value of an element's color property, or the inherited value of the color property if specified as the color property. 
color functions are a bunch of different CSS functions that take the components of a certain color model as arguments.
most css color functions have a variant that ends a and accepts a fourth alpha value.
CSS color functions: rgb/rgba, hsl/hsla
for rgb()/rgba(), the color components can be <percentage>s from 0% to 100%, or <numbers> from 0 to 255
for hsl()/hsla(), the h component is a <angle>, or a <number> between 0 and 360
for hsl()/hsla(), s and l are <number-or-percentages> (how they work is specified in the general color flashcard)
in css, the alpha channel takes a <number-or-percentage-0-1>

##### simple types

the <url> datatype is a css function
url ::= url(<string>) # where string must be a valid url or path or the ID of a SVG shape

##### length

<length> consists of a <number> followed by a <length-unit>.



The <length-percentage> CSS data type represents a value that can be either a <length> or a <percentage>.






## at-rules

### nested at-rules

#### @font-face

@font-face defines a font face for use within the document.
@font-face takes at least a font-family: foo, which is the name we will use to refer to it, and a src, which provides the file for the font itself.
@font-faces src syntax: (<font-face-name>|<url> [format(<string>)]) {<url> [format(<string>)]}
font-face-name: local(<string>) # where the string is the name of a locally-installed font.
calls to local() for @font-faces src should go first since if it finds the font locally, it does not have to load it fron the URL.
for @font-faces src, the first call to local() or url() that is usable will be used.
For the @font-face src call, the format() function takes a string specifying the format of the font, where the font will only be loaded if the browser supports that format.
for @font-face, since you're specifying fonts and not font-families, for different font-weights and font-styles, you must specify multiple @font-face declarations, and within those, specify which font-weight or font-style this is specifying. Only fonts actually used will be loaded. This does not apply to variable fonts.

unicode-range: some-range will only load the font if the document uses the font for at least one character within the range



### non-nested at-rules

@charset "<charset>"; declares the charset, though this is often unnecessary if UTF-8 is desired, as the browser will assume UTF-8 if no charset decaration is present.
@charset must be the first statement in the document if present.

## elements

### replaced elements

In CSS, a replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; they're external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.
Typical replaced elements are:
<iframe>
<video>
<embed>
<img>

Some elements are treated as replaced elements only in specific cases:

<option>
<audio>
<canvas>
<object>
<applet>

Objects inserted using the content property are anonymous replaced elements.

The only way CSS can style replaced elements is by controlling the positioning of the element's content within its box.

The object-whatever properties target replaced elements.

object-position takes a <position> value

## meida queries

Media queries and feature queries have a fair amount of similarities.
Media queries are boolean assertions if the current user's environment/device/UA is a certain way.
Feature queries are boolean assertions if a browser supports a certain set of CSS properties with certain values.
A media query is either true or false for the current user's combination of environment/device/UA.
A feature query is either true or false for the current user's CSS feature set.
Media queries are built from media types, media features, and logical operators.
Media types describe the broad category of device or UA.
Media features describe a specific feature of the environment/device/UA, which can be true or false.
Media queries are most commonly used by @media at-rules, and less frequently by @import at-rules (specified after the meat and potatoes), the media attribute in HTML, and in JS by Window.matchMedia() and MediaQueryList.addListener().
A feature query consists of "feature features" (my coinage) and logical operators.

Media types

all|all devices
print|inteded for printing
screen|intended for screens
speech|intended for speech synthesizers/screen readers

Media types are specified as boolean attributes, i.e. the presence of the keyword is enough

Media features
orientation describes relationship of width and height of the viewport (not the device/screen!)
orientation is portrait if height &gt; width and landscape if width &gt; height
color tests for color depth per channel
resolution tests for pixel density
height tests for height of the viewport
width tests for width of the viewport
aspect-ratio tests for a certain aspect ratio
hover testss whether the user's primary input mechanism can hover
prefers-reduced-motion is used to detect if the user has requested that the system minimize the amount of non-essential motion it uses (this is often an OS-level toggle)

Media features as well as feature features are specified in a (key: value) syntax (parentheses not optional)
for feature features for (key: value), key is a property and value is a possible value.
Media features that are range features can take a min- and a max- version of that feature to specify a range of acceptable values
Level 4 media queries support a more intuitive syntax for range features using &lt;, &gt;, = etc.
Media featurs that are range features: color, resolution, height, width, aspect-ratio

The logical operators that are valid within media queries are and and not (which work as expected), and the comma, which acts as an or, but cannot be nested (i.e. can only combine media queries at the top level). 
as of Level 3 media queries (changes in level 4 media queries), the not keyword can't be used to negate an individual media feature expression, only an entire media query.
feature queries supports similar logical operators to media queries, but instead of the comma, it has a normal or operator, and not can also invert parts of feature queries.
The operator only is mainly useful for preventing browsers from matching if part of the media query applies, and there is another part that they don't understand (e.g. older browsers) and thus ignore.

An @media at-rule is a conditional which takes a media query and executes the CSS contained within if the media query is true.
Multiple @media at-rules may apply at the same time
Syntax @media &lt;media-query&gt; &lt;block&gt;

@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
  article {
    padding: 1rem 3rem;
  }
}

A @supports at-rule is a conditional which takes a feature query
