# NVC

## origin & use

NVC = nonviolent communication.
Violence in NVC is not limited to physical violence.
NVC was developed by ⟮Marshall Rosenberg⟯
Nonviolent Communication may also be callled Compassionate Communication.
According to Marshall, NVC is useable in any relationship, from personal to world diplomacy.

## basics

The main purpose of NVC is to allow us to connect.
Any communication has a life-affirming and a life-alienating version.
life-affirming communication is communication that often allows us to connect with our natural state of compassion and connection.
life-alienating communication is communication that often leads to more violence (in a wide sense) in the world.
Sincer life-affirming communication generally communicates to less violence and life-alienating to more violence, they are also called nonviolent and violent communication respectively.
Ergo, communicating in life-affirming ways, especially through the NVC process, increases the chances of our needs getting met.
The life-alienating version of a particular communication is merely an alienate version of the life-affirming versions and is therefore not bad, it is merely harder for the world to hear it as the life-affirming communication that it is at its heart.
Since even life-alienating communication is merely an alienated version of the life-affirming version of the communication.
The NVC process allows us to percieve and express things as life-affirming communication rather than life-alienating communication.
The NVC process consists of two halves: recieving and expressing.
Both halves of the NVC process are performed through the four components.
For NVC to work, the NVC process is required, as well as maintaining a certain mental state: Being (mentally, emotionally) present with a spirit of compassion.
Being present for NVC requires us to listen 100%.

### 2 parts

the recieving half of NVC may be of communication coming from others/the world, or communication with ourself.
the expressing half of NVC may be to other people, or to ourselves.

#### recieving

the recieving half of NVC can be done silently or verbally.
Recieving a message through the four components can be done whether the message itself is life-alienated or life-affirming, since as we know a life-alienated version hides a life-affirming version underneath.
Paraphrasing is the recieving half of NVC, if done verbally.
The standard formula for NVC paraphrasing is like: Are you sensing A and feeling B because you are needing C. Would D meet your need?
Paraphrasing in particular may either cause the other person to confirm and/or dive more deeply if we are right, or the person to correct us if we are wrong (but this isn't bad either!).
Instead of recieving the message through the four components at all, we may also hear the message in a life-alienated way, by focusing on its intellectual content.

#### expressing

### reactions

For any communication, we can react in four ways:
Hear the message as an attack, and blame ourselves, becoming defensive
Hear the message as an attack, and blame others, lashing out in a counterattack
Use the recieving half of the NVC process on the person/thing communicating.
Use the recieving half of the NVC process on the person recieving the message (generally us).

When we communicate in life-alienating ways, the first two outcomes become more likely, and less likely with life-affirming communication.

### four components

The four component of NVC are:
Each component has a life-affirming version and a life-alienating version.
The life-affirming version and the life-alienating version of a component make up the totality of the thing the component is about.
Mixing the life-affirming version and the life-alienating version of any component will lead to confusion/bad outcomes.

no.|about|component (life-affirming version)|component (life-alienating version)
1st|statements 'about the world'|observations|evaluations
2nd|feelings|thoughts
3rd|needs|
4th|strategies to meet needs|requests|demands

observations trigger needs to be met/unmet, which cause certain feelings. As a consequence, we may or may not make a request.
All four components are completely internal to each person. The life-affirming version clarifies this, while the life-alienating version tries to place the cause of the component outside of the relvant person.
When using the NVC process (both during expressing and recieving), leaving out one or more components may be done, but may also work to imply that the causes for the components expressed/recieved are outside of the relevant person, thus becoming (more) life-alienated.
when engaging in the NVC process, for any of the four components, NVC encourages us to be as specific as possible.
The standard formula for including all four NVC components is When I sense A I feel B because I need C. Would you be willing to do D?  or 
NVC argues that the set of feelings and needs are (nearly) universal.

#### observations

#### feelings

There are a few heuristics is a thing is a feeling or a thought:
1) A thought could cause any number of feelings: Being ignored could correspond to sadness, but also relaxation, relief, freedom, etc.
CNVC groups feelings into two categories, feelings when your needs are met/unmet, and those into some rough categories:
Needs are met: affectionate, engaged, hopeful, confident, excited, grateful, inspired, joyful, exhilarated, peacful, refreshed
Needs are not met: afraid, annoyed, angry, averse, confused, disconnected, disquieted, embarrased, fatigued, in pain, sad, tense, vulnerable, yearning

#### needs

needs may be met or not.

CNVC groups needs into eight rough groups: Connection, physical-wellbeing, honesty, play, peace, autonomy, meaning.

#### strategies

Strategies are the things that fulfill needs.
While there's a somewhat-limited set of needs, the amount of possible strategies to meet these needs are potentially unlimited, and while needs are given, for any given need there might be many strategies to meet it and it may be possible (though not necessarily easy) to change the strategy to get one's needs met.
 
##### requests

Demands & requests are ways to realize the strategies to meet our needs.
Demands want the strategy to happen no matter the persons reaction to the request, enacting sanctions such as criticism, anger, guilt-tripping etc. if not met, ergo accept only submission or rebellion as a reaction.
Requests require the requestee to engage in an NVC process with the persons reaction to the request, even if negative
In addtion, requests may fail if they are not positive (i.e. not don't do X), clear&precise, and actionable.

###### reflection

If you are not sure what the person heard you say (it may be different from what you think you said), requesting a reflection is often useful.
A reflection takes the form "What did you just hear me say?" or similar.

### too charged

When people have feelings and needs that are very active for them in that moment, they may not be able to hear life-affirming communication, even if expressed as such (this includes you!).
If one person in the communication is too charged to hear life-affirming communication as such, it may be necessary to engage via recieving with that person first. 
If all people in the communication are too charged to hear life-affirming communication as such, we may need to exit the conversation to engage in the NVC process with ourselves.

## NVC in a non-NVC world

The vast majority of day-to-day communication (if not explicitly using NVC) is violent.
Everyone involved in violent communication pays dearly for it, including society at large.
NVC encourages acting in a way that satisfies both your and other's needs, by arriving a strategy that does that, called giving from the heart.
Hearing both our and other people's needs at the same time, and people may be used to acting to satisfy other people's needs without listening to their needs due to thinking they are responsible for the feeling of others, called acting from guilt.
Marshall suggests that there is a three-step progression from acting from guilt to giving from the heart: Emotional slavery (only acting from guilt) > the obnoxious stage (overcompensating, being unable to recieve other people's needs) > emotional liberation. (giving from the heart)
Being what society deems a "good X" (good mother, good employee, good black person ...) generally requires you to deny your own needs.
Having often been subjected to more/more extreme life-alienating communication may make it harder to hear life-affirming communication as such.

## animals

Using a metaphor, people who are engaged in compassionate communication are sometimes called giraffes.
Using a metaphor, people who not are engaged in compassionate communication are sometimes called jackals.
The reason for the giraffe metaphor in NVC is that giraffes are the land anima with the largest heart, also their long neck symbolizes awareness.

## details

### anger

In NVC, anger as an emotion is treated somewhat differently: Marshall argues that anger always also has an other, deeper emotion that causes it.

### common confusions

It is important to realize that positive messages (you're good) are as life-alienating as negative messages (you're bad). Positive and negative messages alike benefit from using the NVC process.
NVC may not always feel good, especially since it often requires us to be emotionally vulnerable.
The words 'to feel/want/need/observe/request' do not guarantuee that the thing is actually such, on the reverse, using these exact words is not necessary to be using the four components.

## applications

Since appreciation such as a compliment is a message, NVC encourages expressing and recieving it through the four components, and in particular to avoid the two life-alienated responses of feeling superior due to it, as well as false humility.
NVC offers the tool of roleplaying as someone else and engaging in the NVC process as that person, if the relevant person requests it or is not present.

## intersectionality

People suffering from -isms such as sexism may face additional hurdles in communicating their experiences, even using NVC, due to their intersectional experiences.

# clean language

⟮Clean language⟯ was created  ⟮turn of the 1990s⟯ by ⟮David Grove⟯ 
⟮Clean language argues⟯ (convincingly, to me, citing amongst others ⟮Metaphors we live by⟯) and relies on the fact that ⟮metaphors⟯ are the ⟮the fundamental matter of thought, what we're made of⟯. Thus they are also ⟮very important⟯ to us, and ⟮changing them⟯ is powerful at ⟮affecting change⟯. 
⟮Clean language⟯ assumes that besides ⟮the more general/culture-wide conceptual metaphors described by Lakoff and Johnson⟯, there are also ⟮personal metaphors⟯. 
⟮Clean language⟯ has two roles, the ⟮questioner⟯ and the ⟮speaker⟯. 
The ⟮questioner⟯ in clean language ⟮listens⟯ and then ⟮asks more clean language questions⟯. 
⟮Clean language⟯ emphasizes that if ⟮you repeat the words of the other person⟯, you should ⟮parrot-phrase⟯, that is ⟮use exactly their words⟯. 
⟮Clean language⟯ consists of ⟮twelve questions⟯ and ⟮behaving cleanly⟯, which are both an attempt to ⟮avoid bringing anything that is the questioners⟯, esp. ⟮the questioners's own metaphors⟯ into the conversation. 
The ⟮twelve questions⟯ of ⟮clean language⟯ have been ⟮cleansed of assumptions/metaphors (as far as possible⟯) 
The ⟮twelve clean language questions⟯ are ⟮designed to be asked about metaphors⟯, but ⟮can be asked about anything⟯. 
⟮Behaving cleanly⟯ is acting in such a way to ⟮attempt to avoid bringing anything that is the questioners⟯, esp. ⟮the questioners's own metaphors⟯ into the conversation (this is a ⟮matter of degree⟯, it is ⟮impossible to behave completely cleanly⟯ ). 
⟮Clean language⟯ is designed to ⟮bring greater clarity⟯ and perhaps ⟮change metaphors⟯, and thus ⟮the person as a result of that⟯, however, it ⟮takes its time⟯, and is not designed to ⟮force change⟯. 
Clean language can also be used in ⟮a more casual way⟯ for ⟮more enjoyable socializing⟯. 
Since clean language is ⟮very powerful at shining a spotlight⟯, it may be ⟮better⟯ to ⟮only use it for positive stuff⟯ unless ⟮you know what you're doing⟯. 

## symbols

⟮The things in a persons metaphor world⟯ are called ⟮symbols⟯. 
The thing that ⟮uniquely identifies⟯ a ⟮symbol⟯ is ⟮its name⟯. 
⟮Symbols⟯ start out ⟮vague and shadowy⟯, ⟮asking clean language questions⟯ ⟮increases clarity⟯.

## flower & checking presumptions

⟮clean language⟯ practice exercise: ⟮flower⟯ 1. ⟮One person thinks of a flower for a short while⟯ → 2. ⟮the other person asks clean language questions about it⟯
⟮The flower exercise⟯ tends to reveal that ⟮people have many different flowers in their head⟯.
⟮The fact that people have many different flowers in their head⟯ should remind us of the fact that ⟮other people may be operating with⟯ ⟮very different metaphors⟯ and thus ⟮presumptions⟯ as we are.
The fact that ⟮people may be operating with different metaphors/presumptions⟯ may make it benefitial to ⟮ask clean language questions⟯ about ⟮banal things⟯, esp. when ⟮the stakes are high⟯.

## cultures

The distinction between ask, guess, tell culture comes from a 2007 blog post that got picked up by various blogs and news outlets


table:culture|When you want something...|Requests made to you are seen as...
ask culture|Request, even if you're unsure if it's an imposition|no-able requests
guess culture|Kind of mention the situation and hope the other person offers, directly request only if likely uncontroversial|demand-like requests where no-ing is painful and agonizing
tell culture|Mention your needs structure in detail so that shared benefit and understanding can emerge|requests for details on needs structure for shared benefit

## righting reflex

the ⟮righting reflex⟯ is the impulse to (tell people how to) fix (esp. other peoples) problems when we see them, which rarely produces good results.
