You don't think you can rent out the house, part or whole, because people won't take it, but that's nonsense.
That close to the city center, the rates for even the smallest room upstairs is 500€ on the very low end, and 750€ on the high end. Put it on WG-Gesucht tomorrow morning for 600€ and I guarantee that you'll have 20 serious offers by the end of the day. For the larger upstairs room, you could probably get 800€, if not more. I'm sure you could also get people to move in basically on the drop of a dime, so there's no reason why you couldn't have it rented out in a few days time at most. If you don't believe me, ask anyone my age who's looked for a WG room - there isn't anything, so people will take whatever they can get, at whatever price. Any one of these would generate enough income to more than offset paying me child support. If you feel living with one more person is too much a sacrifice - I find it very hard to feel sorry for someone who will still have half a house worth of space, if not more, as someone who has 12qm.
As to the sacrifices in your standard of living, while I'm sure it sucks, I feel like you might not comprehend what worlds of difference there are between ours: I own 3 sweaters, 4 tshirts, 7ish pairs of underpants, 4 pairs of socks, 2 jackets, a sleeping bag, hygiene articles, a backpack, a helmet, a usb cable, a wall wart, two adapters, a cushion, a pair of headphones (broken headband), a phone, a laptop, a mouse. I don't own anything else. I spend money on rent and on food. Food-wise, I haven't been able to afford to buy a falafel, let alone go out to eat for the last two months. At the supermarket, all I can afford are the cheapest products: 50ct for 500g rolled oats, 1€ for 400g beans, 1€ for a bottle of sunflower oil. Some cheap vegetables maybe, or some tomato sauce instead of just 50ct chopped tomatos if I'm feeling particularly generous - I'm not yet starving, but I am keenly aware that a package of Tofu (at the supermarket) has about 300 kcal for about 2,5€ and about 30% protein - far below the 400 kcal with about the same amount of protein of chickpeas at around 90ct. Ergo: I can't afford the tofu. I've been out (spending money) twice this last 30 days, and by out I mean I went ice skating once and walked around the studentenviertel once. Total cost for both: 8€. And it's not like I'm spending money on anything else either: My various bills come to 50€. I don't spend money on much else: I needed to replace a sweater a few days ago, so I bought one for 18€ at Decathlon. I really like the sweater, but thinking about the 18€, I almost cried.
And as to until when I need the money: It would be nice if I could say 'until the end of my degree', somehow implying that my degree would give me magical employment. But as you yourself seem to be noticing, the economy doesn't really have reasonably-paying humanities (or related) jobs anymore. As I have repeatedly mentioned, for more than a year now I have been working on my computer science skills all day every day. But I'm not done yet. As mentioned in the initial message, until I am at an employable level it will be a few months more at least. In case you think it can be done more quickly - you are free to try your own hand at it! If you can do them well, jobs in software development pay quite well - so if you think it is easy to get to that skill level, you are free to try your hand at it.
