Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies the properties, production and perception of speech sounds, or in the case of sign languages, the equivalent aspects of sign.
Phonetics is traditionally divided into articulatory, acoustic and auditory phonetics.
articulatory phonetics|production of speech sounds
auditory phonetics|perception of speech sounds
acoustic phonetics|acoustic effects on speech sounds

Unit of interest: phones

Language production is the process of production of spoken or written language
Speech production the form of language production where thoughts are translated into speech.


# anatomy

The laryx containes the vocal cords/folds, the gap between which is called the glottis.
The vocal tract is all the anatomy above the laryx used for speech production.
The vocal tract consists of the buccal, oral, nasal and pharyngeal cavities, and the articulators contained within.
Soft palate = velum
The pharynx is the posterior part of the vocal tract, consisting of a tube of muscles sitting above the larynx.
The pharynx = pharyngeal cavity.
the pharynx can be narrowed or closed by the epiglottis, a flap that is usually used to prevent food from entering the larynx.

The buccal cavity is the space between the teeth and the cheeks.
The oral cavity aka the mouth is the space between the pharynx and the lips.

# speech production & distinctive features


## distinctive features

Natural class is a set of phonemes in a language that share certain distinctive features.
Distinctive features are typically grouped into major class features, manner features, place features, and laryngeal features.

## major class features

Major class features are a group of four features that share little in common phonetically, but describe the overall type of a phone.
The four major class features are [+/- syllabic], [+/- approximant], [+/- consonantal or eqivalently +/- vocalic], [+/- sonorant]

### consonants

the distinctive feature [+/- consonantal] is the same as [-/+ vocalic], which one uses is up to preference.
A sound that is [+ consonantal]/[- vocalic] has a stronger narrowing of the vocal tract than a sound with [- consonantal]/[+ vocalic]
Consonants is a natural major class of sounds that are [+ consonantal]/[- vocalic].
Vowels is a natural major class of sounds that are [- consonantal]/[+ vocalic].
Consonants are traditionally categorized by their manner and place of articulation as well as their voicing.

### Sonorants

While manner of articulation is typically only applied to consonants, the distinction between sonorants or obstruents also applies to vowels, which are sonorants.
Speech sounds are either sonorants or obstruents.
Whether something is a sonorant is indicated by the distinctive feature [+son(orant)]

A sonorant is a speech sound that is produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow.
Sonorants that are not voiced are existant but rare.
Sonorants may be said to be made up of approximants in the wide sense and nasals.
Sonorants may be said to be made up of approximants in the narrow sense, vowels, and nasals.

## phonetic production

Phonetic production (my coinage) is the final part of speech production, where actual sound is produced.
Phonetic production occurs in three sequential steps.
The three sequential steps of phonetic production are initiation, phonation and articulation, which occur sequentially.
A phone is a sound produced through phonetic production.
Initiation produces the airstream, which is then shaped via phonation and articulation.

### exceptions

Percussive consonants are consonants produced by two articulators striking each other.
Percussive consonants don't have initiation or phonation, only articulartion.

### initiation

Initation is the production of the airstream via an airstream mechanism.
The initiator is the organ generating the airstream in initation.
The air direction (somewhat rare term) is the direction of the airstream.
The airstream mechanism is the combination of initiator and air direction.

#### initiators

##### names

table:initiator|name
diaphragm+ribs+lungs|pulmonic
glottis|glottalic
tongue|lingual/velaric
cheeks|buccal
esophagus|esophageal

##### choice

In natural human language, the three initiators that may be used are diaphragm+ribs+lungs, glottis, and tongue.
No natural human languages uses the cheeks as an initiator.
In the case of a laryngectomy, the esophagus may be used as an initiator.

#### air direction

Egressive/ingressive are technical terms for outward/inward air direction.
Air direction may be egressive or ingressive.
for egressive air direction, air pressure must be increased.
for ingressive air direction, air pressure must be increased.
Egressive/ingressive sounds are phones with egressive/ingressive air direction.

#### airstream mechanism

There are six possible airstream mechanisms, resulting from the combination of the three common initiators plus two air directions.
There are in fact only four airstream mechanisms commonly used.
Lingual/velaric egressive and pulmonic ingressive are airstream mechanisms which are not commonly used.
Therefore there are four at least somewhat common airstream mechanisms: Pulmonic egressive, glottalic egressive, glottalic ingressive and velaric/lingual ingressive.
Since pulmonic ingressive sounds don't exist, pulmonic is often used to mean pulmonic egressive.
Airstream mechanisms are often dividied into pulmonic and non-pulmonic.
Non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms include glottalic egressive, glottalic ingressive and velaric/lingual ingressive.

##### pulmonic

The pulmonic (egressive) airstream mechanism is the most common form of initiation.
In 75% of languages, the pulmonic (egressive) airstream mechanism is the only one used (!). 

##### non-pulmonic

A closure for initiation consists of two closure points.
The first closure point of all non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms is always an articulator.
For non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms, to produce the airflow, there must be a closure, one of whose closure points is then released.
For non-pulmonic ingressive sounds, between the two closure points something is lowered to create low pressure (suction), and then the second closure points is released.
For non-pulmonic egressive sounds, between the two closure point something is raised to create hig pressure (suction), and then the first closure point is released.
Non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms always produce obstruents.

###### glottalic

In glottalic airstream mechanisms, the second closure point is produced by the glottis.
In glottalic airstream mechanisms, pressure is achieved by the raising/lowwering of the glottis.
implosive are phones produced by an ingressive glottalic airstream mechanism.
ejectives are phones produced by an egressive glottalic airstream mechanism.

###### velaric

For the velaric/lingual ingressive airstream mechanism, the second closrue point is produced by the velum.
Clicks are phones produced by a velaric/lingual ingressive airstream mechanism.

## phonation

The laryngeal features are features that describe how the larynx is involved in speech production.
The three laryngeal distinctive features are [+/- voiced], [+/- aspirated AKA spread glottis], [+/- glottalized AKA constricted glottis]

Phonation is any state of the larynx that modifies the airstream.
Phonation may sometimes more narrowly refer to voicing.
Voicing is the part of phonation where the vocal cords/folds vibrate (or not).
Something voiced has the distinctive feature [+voice]
Something unvoiced or voiceless has the distinctive feature [-voice]
Something voiced becoming voiceless is known as devoicing.
Somehthing voiceless becoming voiced is known as voicing.
voicing|［◌̬］
devoicing|［◌̥］

Aspiration is a laryngeal phenomenon where the vocal folds remain open aka spread after a sound is produced.
For voicelessness, the glottis need to remain open, therefore the feature [+/- spread glottis] is sometimes used for aspirated consonants (and h) as well as voiceless things. Sometimes the distinctive feature of [+/- aspiration] is used instead, and narrowly for aspiration.
Aspiration is indicated in the ipa via ［◌ʰ］
Aspiration seems like a little burst of air to the speaker.
The burst of air for aspiration can be felt by putting ones hand in front of one's mouth while saying an aspirated thing.

Glottalization is the partial or complete closure or constriction of the glottis.
Glottalization as partial constriction results in creaky voice
Glottalization as total constriction produces the glottal stop, or a glottalic consonant if together with a different closure, in this case, it is acting as an initiator.
Glottalization as a laryngeal distinctive feature may be specified as [+/- glottalization or +/- constricted glottis]
glottal consonants have the glottis as their articulatior, in a sense.
There are two manners assoicated with glottal consonants, 'oral' stops and fricatives.
the glottal stop has [+glottalization] [-voice]
the voiceless glottal fricative has [-glottalization] [-voice]
And then there's the breathy-voiced glottal fricative

Creaky voice has [+constricted glottis].
Creaky voice is indicated in the IPA as ［◌̰］

Breathy voice is also called murmured voice.
During breathy voice the vocal folds vibrate, but allow more air to escape.
Breathy voice has [+spread glottis] [+voiced]
Breathy voice is indicated in the IPA as ［◌̤］.

## articulation

Articulation is the shaping of airflow to get a sound.
An articulator is a feature within the vocal tract that is used for articulation.
An active articulator moves to create a speech sound, a passive articulator stays put.
Most often it is the combination of an active and a passive articulatior that performs articulation.

### -> articulation/IPA of clicks/glottalic consonants


⟮ʘ⟯|⟮Bilabial⟯
⟮ǀ⟯|⟮Dental⟯
⟮ǃ⟯|⟮(Post)alveolar⟯
⟮ǂ⟯|⟮Palatoalveolar⟯
⟮ǁ⟯|⟮Alveolar lateral⟯

Mnemonics/Rules

The alveolar click is the only one that uses a punctiation mark as an IPA symbol.


implosives are marked by the IPA via a right-facing hook on top, e.g. ［ɓ］ or ［ɗ］
ejectives are marked by the IPA via ［ʼ］, e.g. ［qʼ］
Implosives are most often voiced oral stops, occasionally voiceless oral stops. 


### Liquids

rhotic consonants are r-like consonants.
Liquid consonants are a grouping of rhotic consonants and voice lateral appoximants.
Liquid consonants are grouped because they often behave similar phonotactically.

Which phoneme the japanese liquid is is completely unclear:
Most commonly it is sait to be a  apico-alveolar tap [ɾ] or an alveolar lateral approximant [l], less commonly various combinations of alveolar, postalveolar or retroflex lateral or non-lateral approximant, tap or stop.

### Place of articulation

The place of articulation is where the obstruction between the articulators occurs.
While the glottis is often seen as a place of articulation, it is involved in phonation at the same time. 
The place of articulation is described by the place distinctive features.
The place of articulation is in theory described by two positions, the position of the passive and the active articulator, however, most active/passive combinations have their own names.

Whether voiceless approximants exist is controversial

#### Passive place of articulation



The upper lip
The upper teeth, either on the edge of the teeth or inner surface 
The alveolar ridge, the gum line just behind the teeth
The back of the alveolar ridge
The hard palate on the roof of the mouth 
The soft palate further back on the roof of the mouth 
The uvula hanging down at the entrance to the throat
The throat itself, a.k.a. the pharynx
The epiglottis at the entrance to the windpipe, above the voice box
all uvular voiced sounds have small-caps IPA symbols
While pharyngeal and epiglottal sounds are sometimes distinguished, there seems to be no clear basis for distinction.
Sounds that have a h/H as an IPA symbol are either pharyngeal/epiglottal or glottal.

#### Active place of articulation

The active place of articulation is roughly divided into labial, coronal, dorsal, radical and laryngeal consonants.
Labial consonants are consonants articulated with the lower lip as the active articulator.
Coronal consonants are consonants articulated with the flexible front part of the tongue as the active articulator.
Coronal consonants are further sudivided into laminal, apical and subapical consonants
Laminal consonants are consonants articulated with the upper front surface of the tongue just behind the tip, called the blade of the tongue.
Apical consonants are consonants articulated with the absolute tip of the tongue.
Subapical consonants are consonants articulated with the underside of the tip of the tongue.
Dorsal consonants are consonants articulated with the body of the tongue as the active articulator.
Radical consonants are consonants articulated with the root/base of of the tongue as the active articulator.
A pharyngeal consonant is a consonant that is articulated primarily in the pharynx. Some phoneticians distinguish upper pharyngeal consonants, or "high" pharyngeals, pronounced by retracting the root of the tongue in the mid to upper pharynx, from (ary)epiglottal consonants, or "low" pharyngeals, which are articulated with the aryepiglottic folds against the epiglottis in the lower larynx, as well as from epiglotto-pharyngeal consonants, with both movements being combined.

marking a given sound as laminal   ◌̻ (a square is lame)
marking a given sound as apical   ［◌̺］

### mapping

While the term retroflex implies that the tongue is actually curled back so that it is subapical at the hard palate, in fact it is often merely apical postalveolar.
palato-alveolar also means the tongue is domed up
Dental or denti-alveolar consonants are often not distinguished from alveolar consonants, as the difference is often not contrastive/phonemic, and this larger group may also be called alveolar.
The larger grouping of alveolar including dental is what has unique IPA symbols - indicating a dental sound specifically must be diacriticised.

### Manner of articulation

The manner of articulation is the configuration of articulators when producing a speech sound.
The manner of articulation is described by the manner distinctive features [+/- continuant], [+/- nasal], [+/- strident], [+/- lateral], [+/- delayed release], plus the major class distinctive features.

#### stops

While stop or occlusive may often refer to merely the oral variety, nore properly they refer to any consonant where the airflow is blocked in the vocal tract, but not necessarily in the nasal tract.
Oral occlusives/stops are occlusives/stops, but so are nasal stops, implosives, ejectives, click consonants and affricates to a certain extent.
In phonetics, liquids are a class of consonants consisting of voiced lateral approximants like /l/ together with rhotics like /r/
stops build up pressure, which needs to be released.
The opposite of a stop or occulusive is a continuant.
Whether something is a stop or continuant is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/- continuant]

#### lateral consonants

A lateral is a consonant in which the airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. 
Whether something is lateral is described by the feature [+/- lateral]
Manners of consonants that can become lateral are fricatives/affricates, approximants, taps/flaps and clicks.

#### Nasals 

A nasal sound is one where velum is lowered to allow air to escape through the nose.
Whether a sound is nasal is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/-] nasal
To indicate a nasal sound for which there is no dedicated ipa letter, ［◌̃］ is used.
A nasal stop is a nasal sound where there is an oral occlusion as well.
Other nasal sounds are nasalized vowels as well as other non-stop nasal consonants.
A nasal is generally though misleadingly used as a term for a nasal stop/nasal occlusive.
There exist voiceless nasals, but no extra IPA symbols for them (they must be diacriticized)


#### Approximants

An approximant is a distinctive feature that encompasses all sonorants except nasals.
In a more narrow definition, approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision to create turbulent airflow. 
Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence.
Although "semivowel" and "approximant" are sometimes treated as synonymous, most authors use the term "semivowel" for a more restricted set; there is no universally agreed-upon definition, and the exact details may vary from author to author.
Not only are semivowels not syllabic, they are are also closer/a type of approximant.


### vowels

Vowels are classified ⟮by the IPA⟯ by ⟮tongue height⟯, ⟮tongue backness⟯, and ⟮lip rounding⟯.
The IPA features *may* be encoded as the distinctive features [+/- high], [+/- back], [+/- round]/
The IPA chart for vowels supposedly shows the height and backness of (the highest point of) the tongue, but this is mostly not true, instead it really shows formant frequencies.
r-colored vowel = rhotic vowel = rhotacized vowel
On a physical level, rhotacization is the lowering of the frenquency of the third formant.
In american english, rs following vowels frequently only indicate the vowels rhotacization.
r-colored vowels are uncommon crosslinguistically, but common in two of the most widely-spoken languages: american english and mandarin chinese.
rhotatication is indicated ［◌˞］ or by a superscript turned r ［ʴ］
the vowel written ə is called schwa

#### monopthongs/dipthongs

Monopthong and dipthong are two kinds of vowels often distinguished.
A monopthong is a vowel sound that stays the same during its articulation = includes one vowel.
A dipthong is a vowel sound that changes between two vowels during articulation = includes two vowels.
A monopthong may be called a pure, a dipthong an impure vowels.
Since a dipthong changes from one vowel to another, it may also be called a glide.

Near front near close vowel's IPA symbols are smallcaps versions of the front close ones.
For the IPA vowel chart, further down more open and further up more closed since it describes tngue height relative to the top of the mouth, at least in theory.
The unrounded version of the back closed vowel is double the u compared the rounded version of the back closed vowel.
the IPA vowels spelled wit oe/E ligatures are both front and both rounded.
ɶ is lower in the vowel chart than œ.
The rounded near-back near-close vowel looks like the ひ kana.

### obstruents

An obstruent is a speech sound that is produced by obstructing airflow.
For obstruents, the vocal tract is either completely closed or closed enough to create turbulence.
All obstruents are consonants, but consonants may also be sonorants
Obstruents are either plosives,  fricatives or affricates.

#### oral occlusives

A plosive/oral occlusive/oral stop is an obstruent consonant in which an occlusion in the vocal tract is formed that stops all airflow.
Plosives are also called oral occlusives or oral stops.
While oral stop, plosive and oral occlusive are synonyms, the terms have different geneses: "Stop" refers to the airflow that is stopped. "Occlusive" refers to the articulation, which occludes (blocks) the vocal tract. "Plosive" refers to the release burst (plosion) of the consonant.
The term plosive may be seen as inappropriate for plosives without an audible release, these are soemtimes called appolosives.

Oral stops can be released in different ways:
no audible release|［◌̚］, e.g. ［p̚］
nasal release|superscript of the relevant nasal stop, e.g. ［◌ⁿ］
lateral release|［◌ˡ］
Oral stops/oral occlusives/plosives with no audible release release their occlusion with no audible burst.
Oral stops with nasal release release the stop into some sort of nasal stop
Oral stops with nasal release release the stop into some sort of lateral consonant



#### fricatives

A fricative are obstruent consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together.
The turulent airflow produced for the formation of fricatives is called frication.
Stridents are a subset of fricatives where additionally a stream of air is directed by the tongue towards the teeth, resulting in higher amplitude and pitch, sibilants are a further subset of these.
Stridency is encoded in the distinctive feature [+/- strident]

#### affricates

An affricate is an obstruent consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative, generally with the same place of articulation.
Affricates in the IPA are indicated by two symbols united by a tie on top or more rarely at the bottom.
p͡f, t͡ɕ etc.
Affricates are distinguised from non-affricates in that they have the disinctive feature [+delayed release]

all retroflex phones feature a right-facing bottom hook in their IPA symbol
all phones written with variants of the small h in the IPA are either epiglottal/pharyngeal or glottal, and are fricatives.

Both the velar and uvular voiceleess fricative are based in their IPA spelling on the x.
Uvular trill and fricative both feature variants of the smallcaps R as their IPA symbols.
phones with a c in their IPA symbol all have a passive place of articulation of palatal, and are voiceless.
In general, phones with greek IPA symbols are similar to phones with the same letter as a latin letter.

### relative articulation

In phonetics and phonology, relative articulation is description of the manner and place of articulation of a speech sound relative to some reference point. 
Dimensions of relative articulation: advanced/retracted, raised/lowered, centralized/mid-centralized and more rarely advanced/retracted tongue root

An advanced or fronted sound is one that is pronounced farther to the front of the vocal tract than some reference point. 
a retracted or backed sound is one that is pronounced farther to the back of the vocal tract.
A raised sound is articulated with the active articulator raised higher than some reference point
A lowered sound is articulated with the active articulator lowered lower than some reference point
A centralized vowel is a vowel that is more central (front-back) than some point of reference.
Mid-centralized vowels are closer to the midpoint of the vowel space than their referent vowels. 
A sound with advanced or retracted tongue root has the base/root of the tongue move forward/backward, expanding/shringking the pharyngeal cavity.
A sound with retracted tongue root may also be seen as pharyngealized.

## signeltons and geminates

Singleton and geminate are two types of consonates distinguished by consonant length.
A geminate consonant is articulated for longer than a singleton.
A geminate consonant is also just called geminate.
The process of a singleton becoming a geminate is called gemination.
In many alphabets, geminates are written with doubled letters.
gemination is phonemic/contrastive in japanese but not in english, german or spanish.
For gemination, lengthened fricatives, nasals, laterals, approximants and trills are simply prolonged. In lengthened stops, the obstruction of the airway is prolonged, which delays release, and the "hold" is lengthened. 
In japanese, gemination is marked by っ.
In japanese, non-phonemic gemination implies emphasis (not in all varieties though).
すごい → すっごい
In japanese, gemination typically only happens to unvoiced consonants (and vowels), voiced consonants only geminate if part of 外来語.
If gemination of voiced consonants happens as part of 外来語, they are often devoiced.

## Coarticulation

Co-articulated consonants are consonants produced with two or more simultaneous places of articulation.

co-articulated consonants
doubly articulated consonants|consonants with secondary articulation

secondary articulation is the articulation that happens when a consonant has two or more places of articulation whose manners are different and at least one of which has the manner of approximant.
Secondary articulation is indicated in the IPA by superscripting the approximant version of the letter, where the place indicated by the superscript is the place which is articulated with the manner of approximant.
Therefore:
labialization (AKA rounding) (secondary articulation)|［◌ʷ］
pharyngealization (secondary articulation)|［◌ˤ］
velarization (secondary articulation)|［◌ˠ］
There is one special symbol for secondary articulation which indicates velarization OR pharyngalization, and is not a superscripted approximant symbol: ［◌̴ ］, as in ［ɫ］
labialization (secondary articulation)|［◌ʷ］
It's important to realize that although the superscripting of a letter for secondary articulation seems to imply that it is simlar to the release diacritics which also use superscripts, in fact secondary articulation is simultaneous to the primary articulation.
In phonetics, vowel roundedness refers to the amount of rounding in the lips during the articulation of a vowel.
Vowel roundedness is labialization of a vowel.
Labialization is a form of secondary articulation involving the lips.
There are two forms of labialization/rounding, protruded rounding anc compressed rounding.
In protruded rounding, the lips push out of the face to produce the rounding.
In compressed rounding, the lip push onto each other and do not push out to produce rounding.
There are no dedicated IPA diacritics to represent the distinction, but the superscript IPA letter ⟨◌ᵝ⟩ or ⟨◌ᶹ⟩ can be used for compression[8] and ⟨◌ʷ⟩ for protrusion.

(lips that are) less rounded/labialized (than usual for that sound)   ◌̜
(lips that are) more rounded/labialized (than usual for that sound)   ［◌̹］

Doubly articulated consonants are consonants with two simultaneous primary places of articulation of the same manner.

# IPA

If there is no 'room' beneath an IPA symbol, you place a diacritic that would normally go there above instead.
For vowels, ［◌ˑ］ indicates a half-length vowel, while ［◌̆］ indicates an extra-short vowel.
For vowels and consonants both, ［◌ː］ indicates something that is longer, for consonants specifically it indicates gemination
Since they got their own diacritic at the 1989 kiel convention, extra-short vowels are ⟮happy⟯ ［◌̆］
