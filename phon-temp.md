TODO
Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies the properties, production and perception of speech sounds, or in the case of sign languages, the equivalent aspects of sign.
Phonetics is traditionally divided into articulatory, acoustic and auditory phonetics.

Language production is the process of production of spoken or written language
Speech production the form of language production where thoughts are translated into speech.

# speech production & distinctive features


## distinctive features

Natural class is a set of phonemes in a language that share certain distinctive features.
Distinctive features are typically grouped into major class features, manner features, place features, and laryngeal features.

## major class features

Major class features are a group of four features that share little in common phonetically, but describe the overall type of a phone.
The four major class features are [+/- syllabic], [+/- approximant], [+/- consonantal or eqivalently +/- vocalic], [+/- sonorant]

### consonants

the distinctive feature [+/- consonantal] is the same as [-/+ vocalic], which one uses is up to preference.
A sound that is [+ consonantal]/[- vocalic] has a stronger narrowing of the vocal tract than a sound with [- consonantal]/[+ vocalic]
Consonants is a natural major class of sounds that are [+ consonantal]/[- vocalic].
Vowels is a natural major class of sounds that are [- consonantal]/[+ vocalic].
Consonants are traditionally categorized by their manner and place of articulation as well as their voicing.

### Sonorants

While manner of articulation is typically only applied to consonants, the distinction between sonorants or obstruents also applies to vowels, which are sonorants.
Speech sounds are either sonorants or obstruents.
Whether something is a sonorant is indicated by the distinctive feature [+son(orant)]

TODO:

A sonorant is a speech sound that is produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow.
Sonorants that are not voiced are existant but rare.
Sonorants may be said to be made up of approximants in the wide sense and nasals.
Sonorants may be said to be made up of approximants in the narrow sense, vowels, and nasals.


#### obstruents

TODO:

An obstruent is a speech sound that is produced by obstructing airflow.
For obstruents, the vocal tract is either completely closed or closed enough to create turbulence.
All obstruents are consonants, but consonants may also be sonorants
Obstruents are either plosives,  fricatives or affricates.

## phonetic production

Phonetic production (my coinage) is the final part of speech production, where actual sound is produced.
Phonetic production occurs in three sequential steps.
The three sequential steps of phonetic production are initiation, phonation and articulation, which occur sequentially.
A phone is a sound produced through phonetic production.
Initiation produces the airstream, which is then shaped via phonation and articulation.

### exceptions

Percussive consonants are consonants produced by two articulators striking each other.
Percussive consonants don't have initiation or phonation, only articulartion.

### initiation

Initation is the production of the airstream via an airstream mechanism.
The initiator is the organ generating the airstream in initation.
The air direction (somewhat rare term) is the direction of the airstream.
The airstream mechanism is the combination of initiator and air direction.

#### initiators

##### names

table:initiator|name
diaphragm+ribs+lungs|pulmonic
glottis|glottalic
tongue|lingual/velaric
cheeks|buccal
esophagus|esophageal

##### choice

In natural human language, the three initiators that may be used are diaphragm+ribs+lungs, glottis, and tongue.
No natural human languages uses the cheeks as an initiator.
In the case of a laryngectomy, the esophagus may be used as an initiator.

#### air direction

Egressive/ingressive are technical terms for outward/inward air direction.
Air direction may be egressive or ingressive.
for egressive air direction, air pressure must be increased.
for ingressive air direction, air pressure must be increased.
Egressive/ingressive sounds are phones with egressive/ingressive air direction.

#### airstream mechanism

There are six possible airstream mechanisms, resulting from the combination of the three common initiators plus two air directions.
There are in fact only four airstream mechanisms commonly used.
Lingual/velaric egressive and pulmonic ingressive are airstream mechanisms which are not commonly used.
Therefore there are four at least somewhat common airstream mechanisms: Pulmonic egressive, glottalic egressive, glottalic ingressive and velaric/lingual ingressive.
Since pulmonic ingressive sounds don't exist, pulmonic is often used to mean pulmonic egressive.
Airstream mechanisms are often dividied into pulmonic and non-pulmonic.
Non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms include glottalic egressive, glottalic ingressive and velaric/lingual ingressive.

##### pulmonic

The pulmonic (egressive) airstream mechanism is the most common form of initiation.
In 75% of languages, the pulmonic (egressive) airstream mechanism is the only one used (!). 

##### non-pulmonic

A closure for initiation consists of two closure points.
The first closure point of all non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms is always an articulator.
For non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms, to produce the airflow, there must be a closure, one of whose closure points is then released.
For non-pulmonic ingressive sounds, between the two closure points something is lowered to create low pressure (suction), and then the second closure points is released.
For non-pulmonic egressive sounds, between the two closure point something is raised to create hig pressure (suction), and then the first closure point is released.
Non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms always produce obstruents.

###### glottalic

In glottalic airstream mechanisms, the second closure point is produced by the glottis.
In glottalic airstream mechanisms, pressure is achieved by the raising/lowwering of the glottis.
implosive are phones produced by an ingressive glottalic airstream mechanism.
ejectives are phones produced by an egressive glottalic airstream mechanism.

###### velaric

For the velaric/lingual ingressive airstream mechanism, the second closrue point is produced by the velum.
Clicks are phones produced by a velaric/lingual ingressive airstream mechanism.

### phonation

Phonation is any state of the larynx that modifies the airstream.
Phonation may sometimes more narrowly refer to voicing.
The laryngeal distinctive features  describe the main axes of phonation.
There are three laryngeal distinctive features.
The three laryngeal distinctive features are [+/- voiced], [+/- aspirated AKA spread glottis], [+/- glottalized AKA constricted glottis]

#### anatomy

Vocal folds = vocal cords.
The larynx containes the vocal folds.
The gap between the vocal folds is called the glottis.
trachea = windpipe.
The larynx sits on top of the trachea.

#### voicing

Voicing is whether the distinctive feature [+/- voice] is present.
[+/- voice] indicates that the vocal cords/folds are vibrating/not vibrating periodically.
Devoicing is something [+ voice] → [- voice]
Voicing is something [- voice] → [+ voice]

##### IPA

table:phenomenon|IPA
voicing|［◌̬］
devoicing|［◌̥］

#### spread glottis

The distinctive feature [+ spread glottis] indicates that the vocal folds are wide open/drawn apart.
All voiceless sounds have [+ spread glottis].
In addition, aspirated stops and consonants with breathy voice have [+ spread glottis].

##### aspiration

Aspiration when the vocal folds remain open after a sound is produced.
ergo [+ spread glottis] for the purposes of aspiration means that the vocal folds remain open ⁑after⁑ the articulation.
Since aspiration works somewhat differently from other [+ spread glottis] features, sometimes [+ aspiration] is used.
Aspiration is indicated in the ipa via ［◌ʰ］
Aspiration feels like a little burst of air to the speaker.
The burst of air for aspiration can be felt by putting ones hand in front of one's mouth while saying an aspirated thing.

##### breathy voice

Breathy voice is also called murmured voice.
Breathy voice is when the vocal folds vibrate, but allow more air to escape.
Breathy voice has [+spread glottis] [+voiced]
Breathy voice is indicated in the IPA as ［◌̤］.

#### constricted glottis

Glottalization is the partial or complete closure or constriction of the glottis.
[+constricted glottis] indicates glottalization.
More rarely, [+ glottalization] can indicate glottalization.
Glottalization may be partial glottalization or total glottalization.
A glottalized consonant/vowel is a consonant/vowel produced at the same time as glottalization.
Stiff voice is very slight glottalization.
Creaky voice is partial glottalization.
Glottal stops, glottalized consonants/vowels and obstruents with an glottal articulatory mechanism all feature total glottalization.

##### glottal consonants

Only some glottal consonants are glottalized (since they are distinguished based on glottalization).
glottal consonants have the glottis as their articulatior, in a sense.
glottal consonants may have two manners, oral stops and fricatives.
the glottal stop has [+constricted glottis] [-voice]
the voiceless glottal fricative has [-constricted glottis] [-voice]
The voiced glottal fricative is also called the breathy-voiced glottal transition.
The voiced glottal fricative has [+spread glottis] [-constricted glottis] [+voice]
And then there's the breathy-voiced glottal fricative

##### IPA

Creaky voice is indicated in the IPA as ［◌̰］

### articulation

Articulation is the shaping of airflow to get a sound.
An articulator is a feature within the vocal tract that is used for articulation.
An active articulator is an articulator that moves.
A passive articulator is an articulator that cannot move.
An articulator pair (rare term) is is the combination of an active and a passive articulatior 
Most often, it is an articulator pair that performs articulation.
The place of articulation is the place where the articulator pair approach each other.
The manner of articulation is the type of approaching/contact that the articulator pair make.
An articulation consists of the place and manner of articulation of an articulatory pair.

#### place of articulation

The place of articulation depends on what the passive and active articulator are, and where on the active articulator the approaching occurs.
The place distinctive features specify the the place of the active articulator.
Most articulations have their own names.
For any passive place of articulation, there are only a few possible active articulator configuration.
Most terms that describe the passive place of articulation also describe the entire place of articulation.
Two sounds are homorganic if they share the same place of articulation.

##### glottis

The glottis is sometimes considered a articulatory pair of its own, though it is more properly part of phonation.

##### anatomy of the vocal tract

https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/35/ds00349_-ds00756_im00110_c7_nasopharynxthu_jpg.jpg
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Illu01_head_neck.jpg

The vocal tract is all the cavities above the larynx and the anatomy contained within.
The vocal tract consists of the buccal, oral, nasal and pharyngeal cavities and everything contained within.
Articulation occurs completely with parts of the vocal tract.
The vocal tract is also used in in some airstream mechanisms.

###### buccal cavity

The buccal cavity is the space between the teeth and the cheeks.

###### oral cavity

The oral cavity is the space between the pharynx and the teeth.
The oral cavity corresponds roughly to what we would ordinarily call the mouth.
The passive places of articulation from dental to uvular sit within the oral cavity.

The alveolar ridge is a gum line just behind the teeth
The uvula is the bulb hanging down at the entrance to the pharyngeal cavity.
From the front, the hard palate comes before the soft palate
The soft palate is also called velum.

###### nasal cavity

###### pharyngeal cavity

The pharyngeal cavity is defined by the pharynx.
The pharyngeal cavity is what we would ordinarily call the throat.
The pharynx is a vertical muscular tube.
The pharynx sits on top of the larynx and extends up into the nasal cavity.
The pharynx as a passive place of articulation is the back of the actual pharynx.
The epiglottis is a flap that sits at the back of the mouth and can seal the epiglottis.

##### passive place of articulation

Passive places of articulation from front to back: labial, dental, prealveolar, alveolar, postalveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, epiglottal, (glottis)


table:name|place
Labial|the upper lip
Dental|the upper teeth, either on the edge of the teeth or inner surface 
Prealveolar|before the alveolar ridge
Alveolar|The alveolar ridge
Postalveolar|The back of the alveolar ridge
Palatal|The hard palate
Velar|The soft palate
Uvular|The uvula 
Pharyngeal|The pharynx
Epiglottal|The walls at the entrance to the trachea


##### active place of articulation

The four place distinctive features are [labial], [coronal], [dorsal], [radical]
The four place distinctive features (plus pharyngeal, which isn't a distinctive feature) specify the place of the active articulator
Ergo, labial sounds are those with [labial], coronal sounds are those with [coronal], etc.
Labial sounds ([labial]) are articulated with the lower lip as the active articulator.
Coronal, dorsal and radical sounds are all articulated with the tongue as the active articulator.

###### labial

Labial sounds may have a specific degree of rounding.
Rounding is how round the lips are.
Labial sounds with a high degree of rounding is indicated by the distinctive feature [+ round]

####### types

There are two forms of rounding, protruded rounding anc compressed rounding.
In protruded rounding, the lips push out of the face to produce the rounding.
In compressed rounding, the lip push onto each other and do not push out to produce rounding.
There are no dedicated IPA diacritics to represent the distinctio between compressed and protruded rounding.
In absence of a dedicated IPA letter,  ⟨◌ᵝ⟩ or ⟨◌ᶹ⟩ are sometimes used for compressed rounding.
In absence of a dedicated IPA letter, ⟨◌ʷ⟩ are sometimes used for protruded rounding.

####### as secondary articulation

Labialization is secondary articulation that is labial.
For consonants, labialization if not further specified generally refers to labialization with very little rounding.
Vowel rounding is just labialization of vowels with a specific degree of rounding.
labialization is indicated in the IPA as［◌ʷ］.
Labialization is the most common form of secondary articulation.
Labialized sounds' places of articulation are often called labio-‹primary-articulation-place›.

######## common labialized consonants

Since labialization is so common, dedicated IPA letters exist for some labialized sounds.
⟮［ɥ］⟯ is a ⟮voiced⟯ ⟮labio-palatal⟯ ⟮approximant⟯

######### labiovelars

The most common labialized consonants are the labiovelars.
［⟮ʍ⟯］ is a ⟮voice​less⟯ ⟮labio​velar⟯ ⟮approxi​mant⟯
［⟮w⟯］ is a ⟮voiced⟯ ⟮labiovelar⟯ ⟮approximant⟯

####### relative articulation

Sounds having a greater/lesser degree of rounding as usual may be indicated in the IPA by a half-circle below the symbol


table:rounding|symbol
less rounding|［◌̜］
more rounding|［◌̹］

###### tongue

####### coronal

Coronal sounds are articulated with tongue as the active articulator, and with the flexible front part of that.
Coronal sounds are further sudivided into laminal, apical and subapical sounds.
The tip of the tongue is its absolute tip, just in front of the blade.
The blade of the tongue is the upper front surface of the tongue just behind the tip.
Laminal sounds are actively articulated with the blade of the tongue.
Apical sounds are actively articulated with ⟮＿the tip of the tongue＿⟯.
Subapical sounds are sounds articulated with the underside of the tip of the tongue.
Laminal and subapical sounds are identified by the distinctive feature [+ distributed].
Apical sounds are identified by the distinctive feature [- distributed].

######## ipa

The subdivision of coronal sounds can only be indicated by diacritics.


table:coronal articulation|symbol|mnemonic
laminal|［◌̻］|a square is lame
apical|［◌̺］

####### dorsal

Dorsal sounds are sounds articulated with the body of the tongue as the active articulator.
For consonants, only [+/- dorsal] is generally relevant, however all vowels are [+ dorsal], and therefore specify further distinctive features.
The further distinctive feature subdivision of [+ dorsal] is [+/- high/mid/low], [+/- back/central/front]

####### radical 

Radical sounds are sounds articulated with the root/base of of the tongue as the active articulator.

####### pharyngeal

A pharyngeal consonant is a consonant that is articulated primarily in the pharynx.

###### distinctive features

Coronal sounds that are dental, prealveolar and alveolar are [+ anterior]/[- posterior]
Coronal sounds that are postalveolar are [- anterior]/[+ posterior]

###### details

The term retroflex should impliy that the tongue is curled (subapical palatal), in fact it is often merely apical postalveolar.
palato-alveolar also means the tongue is domed up.
Dental or denti-alveolar consonants are often not distinguished from alveolar consonants,as the difference is often not contrastive/phonemic
The larger group dental, denti-alveolar, alveolar may also be called alveolar.
Only alveolar in the larger sense has unique IPA symbols outside of fricatives.

#### manner of articulation

The manner of articulation is described by 5 manner distinctive features.
The 5 manner distinctive features are [+/- continuant], [+/- nasal], [+/- strident], [+/- lateral], [+/- delayed release].

##### continuant

In all cases, stop is a synonym to occlusive.
A continuant is the opposite of an occlusive.
Whether something is a continuant or occlusive is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/- continuant].
An occlusive is a sound that obstructs airflow anywhere but the nose.
Oral stop/occlusive may be shortened to stop/occlusive, but this is confusing, so I won't.

###### release

The release release (my term) of an occlusive is when the articulators are separated.
The only-maybe-release (my term) of an occlusive is when the next phone starts, no matter if the articulators don't cease to make contact.
Release is ambiguous between release release and only-maybe-release
A sound with a silent release (my term) has a release release that is silent.
A sound with a no release (my term) has no release release, only a only-maybe-release, instead transitioning without release to the next phone.
A no release must generally be homorganic.
No audible release is ambiguous between silent release and no release.
A lateral release is a no release where the next phone is a lateral sound.
A nasal release is a no release where the next phone is a nasal sound.
Any occlusive can be only-maybe-released in a variety of ways.

####### affricate

An affricate is a stop with a release release as a fricative, or equivalently, a no release into a fricative.
Whether something is an affricate is indicated by the disinctive feature [+/- delayed release]
Affricates in the IPA are indicated by two symbols united by a tie on top or more rarely at the bottom.
p͡f, t͡ɕ etc.

####### IPA

table:name|symbol
no audible release|［◌̚］, e.g. ［p̚］
nasal release|superscript of the relevant nasal stop, e.g. ［◌ⁿ］
lateral release|［◌ˡ］

##### nasals 

A nasal is one where velum is lowered to allow air to escape through the nose.
Whether a sound is nasal is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/-] nasal
To indicate a nasal sound for which there is no dedicated ipa letter, ［◌̃］ is used.

##### occlusive + nasal

###### oral occlusive

An oral occlusive is [- continuant] [- nasal]. (i.e. an oral closure with no lowered velum)
Oral occlusives may also be called plosives.
Oral occlusives without an audible release may sometimes be called applosives.
Oral occlusive may be shortened to stop/occlusive, but this is confusing, so I won't.

####### implosives

Implosives are always oral occlusives.
Implosives are most often voiced.

###### nasal occlusive

A nasal occlusive is [- continuant] [+ nasal]. (i.e. an oral closure with lowered velum)
Nasal occlusive may be shortened to nasal, but this is confusing, so I won't.

##### lateral consonants

A lateral is a sound in which the airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. 
Whether something is lateral is described by the distinctive feature [+/- lateral]
Manners of consonants that can become lateral are fricatives/affricates, approximants, taps/flaps and clicks.

##### approximants

Approximants (wide sense) are those sounds that allow a frictionless escape of air.
Whether something is an approximant in the wise sense is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/- approximant].
Approximants (narrow sense) are those sounds that have some narrowing but still allow a frictionless escape of air.
Approximants (narrow) sense fall between fricatives and vowels.

##### fricatives

A fricative are obstruent consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together.
The turulent airflow produced for the formation of fricatives is called frication.
Stridents are a subset of fricatives where additionally a stream of air is directed by the tongue towards the teeth.
The sound produced by stridents is in higher amplitude and pitch.
Sibilants are a further subset of stridents.
Stridency is encoded in the distinctive feature [+/- strident].
Sibilancy may sometimes be encoded in the distinctive feature [+/- sibilant]

#### coarticulation

Co-articulated sounds are produced with two or more simultaneous places of articulation.
Co-articulated sounds may be doubly articulated sounds or sounds with secondary articulation.

##### secondary articulation

A sound with secondary articulation is a co-articulated sound whose second place of artculation has a manner of approximant.
Secondary articulation is indicated in the IPA by superscripting the approximant version of the letter, where the place indicated by the superscript is the place which is articulated with the manner of approximant.
Names for secondary articulation take the name of the passive place of articulation and add -ization.
e.g. labialization:［◌ʷ］, pharyngealization:［◌ˤ］, velarization:［◌ˠ］
［ɫ］is an exeption, indicating velarization or pharyngialization.
Although the superscripting of a letter for secondary articulation seems to imply that it is simlar to the release diacritics which also use superscripts, in fact secondary articulation is simultaneous to the primary articulation.

##### doubly articulated cononants

Doubly articulated sounds are are co-articulated sounds whose places share the same manner.

#### vowels

TODO

Vowels are classified ⟮by the IPA⟯ by ⟮tongue height⟯, ⟮tongue backness⟯, and ⟮lip rounding⟯.
The IPA features *may* be encoded as the distinctive features [+/- high], [+/- back], [+/- labial/round]/
The IPA chart for vowels supposedly shows the height and backness of (the highest point of) the tongue, but this is mostly not true, instead it really shows formant frequencies.

##### rhotacization

TODO

r-colored vowel = rhotic vowel = rhotacized vowel
On a physical level, rhotacization is the lowering of the frenquency of the third formant.
In american english, rs following vowels frequently only indicate the vowels rhotacization.
r-colored vowels are uncommon crosslinguistically, but common in two of the most widely-spoken languages: american english and mandarin chinese.
rhotatication is indicated ［◌˞］ or by a superscript turned r ［ʴ］
the vowel written ə is called schwa

##### monopthongs/dipthongs

TODO

Monopthong and dipthong are two kinds of vowels often distinguished.
A monopthong is a vowel sound that stays the same during its articulation = includes one vowel.
A dipthong is a vowel sound that changes between two vowels during articulation = includes two vowels.
A monopthong may be called a pure, a dipthong an impure vowels.
Since a dipthong changes from one vowel to another, it may also be called a glide.

#### relative articulation

TODO

In phonetics and phonology, relative articulation is description of the manner and place of articulation of a speech sound relative to some reference point. 
Dimensions of relative articulation: advanced/retracted, raised/lowered, centralized/mid-centralized and more rarely advanced/retracted tongue root

An advanced or fronted sound is one that is pronounced farther to the front of the vocal tract than some reference point. 
a retracted or backed sound is one that is pronounced farther to the back of the vocal tract.
A raised sound is articulated with the active articulator raised higher than some reference point
A lowered sound is articulated with the active articulator lowered lower than some reference point
A centralized vowel is a vowel that is more central (front-back) than some point of reference.
Mid-centralized vowels are closer to the midpoint of the vowel space than their referent vowels. 
A sound with advanced or retracted tongue root has the base/root of the tongue move forward/backward, expanding/shringking the pharyngeal cavity.
A sound with retracted tongue root may also be seen as pharyngealized.

###### mnemonics

The alveolar click is the only one that uses a punctiation mark as an IPA symbol.


##### mnemonics

all retroflex phones feature a right-facing bottom hook in their IPA symbol
all phones written with variants of the h in the IPA are either epiglottal/pharyngeal or glottal, and are fricatives.

Both the velar and uvular voiceleess fricative are based in their IPA spelling on the x.
Uvular trill and fricative both feature variants of the smallcaps R as their IPA symbols.
phones with a c in their IPA symbol all have a passive place of articulation of palatal, and are voiceless.
In general, phones with greek IPA symbols are similar to phones with the same letter as a latin letter.
all uvular voiced sounds have small-caps IPA symbols

##### glottalic consonants

implosives are marked by the IPA via a right-facing hook on top of the symbol for the relevant equivalent oral occlusive, e.g. ［ɓ］ or ［ɗ］
ejectives are marked by the IPA via ［ʼ］, e.g. ［qʼ］

Near front near close vowel's IPA symbols are smallcaps versions of the front close ones.
For the IPA vowel chart, further down more open and further up more closed since it describes tngue height relative to the top of the mouth, at least in theory.
The unrounded version of the back closed vowel is double the u compared the rounded version of the back closed vowel.
the IPA vowels spelled wit oe/E ligatures are both front and both rounded.
ɶ is lower in the vowel chart than œ.
The rounded near-back near-close vowel looks like the ひ kana.

### Liquids

rhotic consonants are r-like consonants.
Liquid consonants are a grouping of rhotic consonants and voice lateral appoximants.
Liquid consonants are grouped because they often behave similar phonotactically.

Which phoneme the japanese liquid is is completely unclear:
Most commonly it is sait to be a  apico-alveolar tap [ɾ] or an alveolar lateral approximant [l], less commonly various combinations of alveolar, postalveolar or retroflex lateral or non-lateral approximant, tap or stop.
In phonetics, liquids are a class of consonants consisting of voiced lateral approximants like /l/ together with rhotics like /r/

## signeltons and geminates

Singleton and geminate are two types of consonates distinguished by consonant length.
A geminate consonant is articulated for longer than a singleton.
A geminate consonant is also just called geminate.
The process of a singleton becoming a geminate is called gemination.
In many alphabets, geminates are written with doubled letters.
gemination is phonemic/contrastive in japanese but not in english, german or spanish.
For gemination, lengthened fricatives, nasals, laterals, approximants and trills are simply prolonged. In lengthened stops, the obstruction of the airway is prolonged, which delays release, and the "hold" is lengthened. 
In japanese, gemination is marked by っ.
In japanese, non-phonemic gemination implies emphasis (not in all varieties though).
すごい → すっごい
In japanese, gemination typically only happens to unvoiced consonants (and vowels), voiced consonants only geminate if part of 外来語.
If gemination of voiced consonants happens as part of 外来語, they are often devoiced.

# IPA

If there is no 'room' beneath an IPA symbol, you place a diacritic that would normally go there above instead.
For vowels, ［◌ˑ］ indicates a half-length vowel, while ［◌̆］ indicates an extra-short vowel.
For vowels and consonants both, ［◌ː］ indicates something that is longer, for consonants specifically it indicates gemination
Since they got their own diacritic at the 1989 kiel convention, extra-short vowels are ⟮happy⟯ ［◌̆］
