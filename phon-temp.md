## three steps

»⟮Phonetic production⟯« (my coinage) is ⟮the ＿expression＿ stage (cf. fundamental concepts > what is language > language production)⟯ of ⟮＿speech production＿⟯, where ⟮actual sound is produced⟯.
⟮＿Phonetic production＿⟯ occurs in ⟮three⟯ ⟮sequential⟯ ⟮steps⟯.
⟮The three sequential steps of ＿phonetic production＿⟯ are ⟮＿initiation＿⟯, ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ and ⟮＿articulation＿⟯.
For ⟮＿phonetic production＿⟯, ⟮＿initiation＿⟯ ⟮produces the ＿airstream＿⟯, which is then ⟮shaped⟯ via ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ and ⟮＿articulation＿⟯.

### exceptions

»⟮Percussive consonants⟯« are ⟮＿consonants＿⟯ produced by ⟮two ＿articulators＿ striking each other⟯.
⟮＿Percussive consonants＿⟯ don't have ⟮＿initiation＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿phonation＿⟯, only ⟮c_;＿articulartion＿⟯.

### articulation

»⟮Articulation⟯« is ⟮the shaping⟯ of ⟮＿the airflow＿⟯ to ⟮get a sound⟯.
»⟮An articulator⟯« is ⟮a feature⟯ ⟮within ＿the vocal tract＿⟯ that is ⟮used for ＿articulation＿⟯.
»⟮An active articulator⟯« is ⟮＿an articulator＿⟯ that ⟮moves⟯.
»⟮A passive articulator⟯« is ⟮＿an articulator＿⟯ that ⟮cannot move⟯.
⟮＿Articulation＿⟯ requires ⟮＿the active＿ and ＿passive articulator＿⟯ to ⟮approach each other⟯.
»⟮An articulation⟯« is⟮ the place and manner⟯ of ⟮the approach⟯ of ⟮＿an articulator pair＿⟯.
»⟮An articulator pair⟯« are ⟮＿the active＿ and ＿passive articulator＿⟯ involved in ⟮＿an articulation＿⟯.
»⟮The place of articulation⟯« is ⟮the place⟯ of ⟮the approach⟯ of ⟮＿the articulatory pair＿⟯ of ⟮＿an articulation＿⟯.
»⟮The manner of articulation⟯« is ⟮the manner⟯ of ⟮the approach⟯ of ⟮＿the articulatory pair＿⟯ of ⟮＿an articulation＿⟯.
⟮＿The place of articulation＿⟯ can be divided into ⟮＿active＿ and ＿passive place of articulation＿⟯.
»⟮The active/passive articulator⟯« is ⟮a specific ＿active/passive articulator＿⟯ involved in ⟮a given ＿articulation＿⟯.
»⟮The active/passive place of articulation⟯« is ⟮where on⟯ ⟮＿the active/passive articulator＿⟯ ⟮the approach takes place⟯.

## IPA

### general principles

Generally, if ⟮there is no 'room'⟯ ⟮beneath⟯ an IPA symbol, you place a diacritic that would normally go there ⟮above⟯ instead.

#### mnemonics

all retroflex phones feature a right-facing bottom hook in their IPA symbol
all phones written with variants of the h in the IPA are either epiglottal/pharyngeal or glottal, and are fricatives.

Both the velar and uvular voiceleess fricative are based in their IPA spelling on the x.
Uvular trill and fricative both feature variants of the smallcaps R as their IPA symbols.
phones with a c in their IPA symbol all have a passive place of articulation of palatal, and are voiceless.
In general, phones with greek IPA symbols are similar to phones with the same letter as a latin letter.
all uvular voiced sounds have small-caps IPA symbols

#### glottalic consonants

implosives are marked by the IPA via a right-facing hook on top of the symbol for the relevant equivalent oral occlusive, e.g. ［ɓ］ or ［ɗ］
ejectives are marked by the IPA via ［ʼ］, e.g. ［qʼ］

### vowels

!table:             |⟮Front⟯|⟮c_;Central⟯|⟮c_;Back⟯
!type=th;⟮Close⟯     |⟮i⟯•⟮y⟯  |⟮ɨ⟯•⟮ʉ⟯     |⟮ɯ⟯•⟮u⟯
!type=th;⟮Near-close⟯|⟮ɪ⟯•⟮ʏ⟯  |          |•⟮ʊ⟯
!type=th;⟮Close-mid⟯ |⟮e⟯•⟮ø⟯  |⟮ɘ⟯•⟮ɵ⟯     |⟮ɤ⟯•⟮o⟯

!type=th;⟮Open⟯      |⟮a⟯•⟮ɶ⟯  |⟮ä⟯•       |⟮ɑ⟯•⟮ɒ⟯

The near-close are most commonly also only near-back/near-front (instead of fully so like shown in the able)
Near front near close vowel's IPA symbols are smallcaps versions of the front close ones.
For the IPA vowel chart, further down more open and further up more closed since it describes tngue height relative to the top of the mouth, at least in theory.
The unrounded version of the back closed vowel is double the u compared the rounded version of the back closed vowel.
the IPA vowels spelled wit oe/E ligatures are both front and both rounded.
ɶ is lower in the vowel chart than œ.
The rounded near-back near-close vowel looks like the ひ kana.
the vowel written ⟮ə⟯ is called ⟮schwa⟯

## length

»⟮The length⟯« of a phone is ⟮its extension in time⟯ ⟮relative to⟯ other phones.
⟮［◌ˑ］⟯ indicates something that is ⟮half-length⟯.
⟮［◌̆］⟯ indicates something that is ⟮extra-short⟯.
⟮［◌ː］⟯ indicates something that is ⟮longer/lengthened⟯.

### gemination

»⟮Gemination⟯« is ⟮the lengthening⟯ of ⟮＿consonants＿⟯.
»⟮A geminate⟯« is ⟮＿a consonant＿⟯ ⟮exhibiting gemination⟯.
»⟮A singleton⟯« is ⟮not ＿a geminate＿ (i.e. regular length)⟯
In many alphabets, ⟮＿geminates＿⟯ are written with ⟮doubled letters⟯.
⟮＿Oral occlusives＿⟯ experience ⟮＿gemination＿⟯ by ⟮holding the closure⟯.
⟮＿Nasal occlusives＿⟯ and ⟮＿continuants (which contain vowels, though it is rarely called ⟮s_+;gemination⟯ for vowels)＿⟯ experience ⟮＿gemination＿⟯ by ⟮lengthening of the sound⟯.
