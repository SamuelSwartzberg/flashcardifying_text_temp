## three steps

»⟮Phonetic production⟯« (my coinage) is ⟮the ＿expression＿ stage (cf. fundamental concepts > what is language > language production)⟯ of ⟮＿speech production＿⟯, where ⟮actual sound is produced⟯.
⟮＿Phonetic production＿⟯ occurs in ⟮three⟯ ⟮sequential⟯ ⟮steps⟯.
⟮The three sequential steps of ＿phonetic production＿⟯ are ⟮＿initiation＿⟯, ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ and ⟮＿articulation＿⟯.
For ⟮＿phonetic production＿⟯, ⟮＿initiation＿⟯ ⟮produces the ＿airstream＿⟯, which is then ⟮shaped⟯ via ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ and ⟮＿articulation＿⟯.

### exceptions

»⟮Percussive consonants⟯« are ⟮＿consonants＿⟯ produced by ⟮two ＿articulators＿ striking each other⟯.
⟮＿Percussive consonants＿⟯ don't have ⟮＿initiation＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿phonation＿⟯, only ⟮c_;＿articulartion＿⟯.

### initiation

»⟮The airsteam⟯« is ⟮the stream of air⟯ which ⟮eventually becomes the sound⟯.
»⟮Initation⟯« is ⟮the production of⟯ ⟮＿the airstream＿⟯ via ⟮＿an airstream mechanism＿⟯.
»⟮The initiator⟯« is ⟮the organ⟯ ⟮generating ＿the airstream＿⟯ in ⟮＿initation＿⟯.
»⟮The air direction⟯« (somewhat rare term) is ⟮the direction of ＿the airstream＿⟯.
»⟮The airstream mechanism⟯« is how the airstream is generated.
»⟮The airstream mechanism⟯« is defined by the choice of ⟮＿initiator＿⟯ and ⟮＿air direction＿⟯.
The airstream mechanism's initator may be defined by a set of adjectives corresponding to the initiator.

###### distinctive features

Sounds with a ⟮＿coronal＿⟯ ⟮＿active place of articulation supercategory＿⟯ that have ⟮＿a dental, prealveolar or alveolar＿⟯ ⟮＿passive place of articulation＿⟯ have the distinctive feature ⟮[+anterior]/[-posterior]⟯
Sounds with a ⟮＿coronal＿⟯ ⟮＿active place of articulation supercategory＿⟯ that have a ⟮＿postalveolar＿⟯ ⟮＿passive place of articulation＿⟯ have the distinctive feature ⟮[-anterior]/[+posterior]⟯

###### details

»⟮Retroflex⟯« (strong) is when ⟮the tongue is curled⟯, which generally means ⟮＿subapical＿⟯ and ⟮＿palatal＿ (ggf ＿postalveolar＿)⟯.
»⟮Retroflex⟯« (weak/technically not) is ⟮＿apical＿⟯ ⟮＿postalveolar＿⟯.
⟮The difference between⟯ ⟮＿dental＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿denti-alveolar＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿alveolar＿⟯ ⟮＿places of articulation＿⟯ is generally not ⟮＿phonemic＿⟯
The larger group ⟮＿dental＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿denti-alveolar＿⟯, ⟮＿alveolar＿⟯ may also be called »⟮alveolar (in the larger sense)⟯«.
The IPA only has ⟮different symbols for⟯ ⟮＿dental, denti-alveolar and alveolar＿⟯ for ⟮＿fricatives＿⟯

#### manner of articulation

Featurally, the ⟮＿manner of articulation＿⟯ is described by ⟮5⟯ ⟮＿manner distinctive features＿⟯.
⟮The 5 ＿manner distinctive features＿⟯ are ⟮[+/- continuant]⟯, ⟮[+/- nasal]⟯, ⟮[+/- strident]⟯, ⟮[+/- lateral]⟯, ⟮[+/- delayed release]⟯.

##### continuant

In all cases, ⟮stop⟯ is a synonym to ⟮occlusive⟯.
An occlusive is a sound that obstructs airflow anywhere but the nose.
⟮＿A continuant＿⟯ is the opposite of ⟮＿an occlusive＿⟯.
Whether something is ⟮＿a continuant or occlusive＿⟯ is indicated by the distinctive feature ⟮[+/- continuant]⟯.
⟮Oral occlusive⟯ may be shortened to ⟮stop/occlusive⟯, but this is confusing, so I won't.

###### release

»⟮The release release⟯« (my term) of ⟮＿an occlusive＿⟯ is ⟮when ＿the articulators＿ are separated⟯.
A sound with »⟮a silent release⟯« (my term) has ⟮＿a release release＿⟯ that ⟮is silent⟯.
A sound with »⟮a no release release⟯« (my term) has ⟮no ＿release release＿⟯, ⟮instead transitioning to the next phone⟯.
⟮＿A no release release＿⟯ must generally be ⟮＿homorganic＿⟯.
»⟮Release⟯« is ⟮ambiguous between⟯ ⟮＿release release＿⟯ and ⟮＿no release release＿⟯.
»⟮A only-maybe-release⟯« (my term) is either ⟮⟮＿a release release＿⟯ (including possibly ⟮＿a silent release＿⟯)⟯ or ⟮＿a no-release release.＿⟯
»⟮No audible release⟯« is ⟮ambiguous between⟯ ⟮＿silent release＿⟯ and ⟮＿no release release＿⟯.
»⟮A lateral release⟯« is ⟮＿a no release release＿⟯ where ⟮the next ＿speech sound＿⟯ is a ⟮＿lateral＿⟯ sound.
»⟮A nasal release⟯« is ⟮＿a no release release＿⟯ where ⟮the next ＿speech sound＿⟯ is a ⟮＿nasal＿⟯ sound.

####### affricate

»⟮An affricate⟯« is ⟮＿an occlusive＿⟯ with ⟮＿a release release＿⟯ ⟮as ＿a fricative＿⟯, or equivalently, ⟮c-;＿a no release release＿⟯ ⟮into ＿a fricative＿⟯.
Whether something is ⟮＿an affricate＿⟯ is indicated by the disinctive feature ⟮[+/- delayed release]⟯
⟮＿Affricates＿⟯ are transcribed in the IPA by ⟮uniting⟯ ⟮the ＿occlusive＿ and ＿fricative＿⟯ with ⟮a tie⟯ ⟮on top⟯ or more rarely ⟮c_;at the bottom⟯.
p͡f, t͡ɕ etc.

####### IPA

table:name|symbol
⟮no audible release⟯|⟮［◌̚］, e.g. ［p̚］⟯
⟮nasal release⟯|⟮superscript of the relevant nasal stop, e.g. ［◌ⁿ］⟯
⟮lateral release⟯|⟮［◌ˡ］⟯

##### nasals 

A sound is »⟮nasal⟯« if ⟮＿the velum＿⟯ is ⟮lowered⟯ to ⟮allow air to escape through the nose⟯.
Whether a sound is ⟮＿nasal＿⟯ is indicated by the distinctive feature ⟮[+/- nasal] ⟯
To indicate a ⟮＿nasal＿⟯ sound for which there is no dedicated ipa letter, ⟮［◌̃］⟯ is used.

##### occlusive + nasal

###### oral occlusive

»⟮An oral occlusive⟯« is ⟮[-continuant] [-nasal]. (i.e. an oral closure with no lowered velum)⟯
⟮＿Oral occlusives＿⟯ may also be called ⟮plosives⟯.
»⟮An applosive⟯« is a ⟮＿oral occlusives＿⟯ with ⟮＿a silent release＿⟯

####### implosives

⟮＿Implosives＿⟯ are always ⟮＿oral occlusives＿⟯.
⟮＿Implosives＿⟯ are most often ⟮＿voiced＿⟯.

###### nasal occlusive

»⟮A nasal occlusive⟯« is ⟮[-continuant] [+nasal]. (i.e. an oral closure with lowered velum)⟯
⟮＿Nasal occlusive＿⟯ may be shortened to ⟮nasal⟯, but this is confusing, so I won't.

##### lateral consonants

»⟮A lateral⟯« is a sound in which ⟮＿the airstream＿ proceeds⟯ ⟮along the sides of the tongue⟯ and ⟮is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth⟯. 
Whether something is ⟮＿lateral＿⟯ is described by the distinctive feature ⟮[+/- lateral]⟯
Manners of consonants that can become ⟮＿lateral＿⟯ are ⟮＿fricatives/affricates＿⟯, ⟮approximants⟯, ⟮taps/flaps⟯ and ⟮clicks⟯.

##### approximants

»⟮Approximants (narrow)⟯« are those sounds that ⟮have some narrowing⟯ but ⟮still allow a mostly frictionless escape of air⟯.
⟮＿Approximants (narrow)＿⟯ ⟮fall between⟯ ⟮＿fricatives＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿vowels＿⟯.

##### fricatives

»⟮Fricatives⟯« are those sounds that ⟮produce ＿frication＿⟯.
»⟮frication⟯« is ⟮turbulent⟯ ⟮＿airflow＿⟯.
»⟮frication⟯« is produced by ⟮forcing air⟯ ⟮through a narrow channel⟯ made by ⟮placing ＿the articulator pair＿ close together⟯.

###### stridents

»⟮Stridents⟯« are ⟮a subset of⟯ ⟮＿fricatives＿⟯ which contains ⟮＿sibilants＿⟯ as well as ⟮labiodental and uvular fricatives⟯.
The sound produced by ⟮＿stridents＿⟯ is ⟮higher⟯ in ⟮amplitude⟯ and ⟮c_;pitch⟯.

###### sibilant

»⟮Sibilants⟯« are ⟮a further subset⟯ of ⟮＿stridents＿⟯ where ⟮＿the airstream＿⟯ is ⟮directed by the tongue⟯ ⟮towards the teeth⟯.
⟮＿Sibilants＿⟯ have a ⟮characteristically intense⟯ sound.
All ⟮＿sibilants＿⟯ have ⟮＿an active place of articulation supercategory＿⟯ of ⟮＿coronal＿⟯.
⟮＿Fricatives＿⟯ with ⟮＿an active place of articulation supercategory＿⟯ of ⟮＿coronal＿⟯ are ⟮prototypically⟯ ⟮＿sibilants＿⟯, outside of the ⟮＿dental＿⟯ ones.
The ⟮IPA symbols⟯ for ⟮the coronal fricatives (outside of dental obv)⟯ imply ⟮＿sibilancy＿⟯.
⟮Non-sibilant⟯ ⟮coronal fricatives⟯ exist, but ⟮must be diacriticized, e.g. from the dental fricatives⟯

⟮＿Sibilants＿⟯ may be divided into the ⟮＿hissing＿⟯ and the ⟮c_;＿hushing＿⟯ ⟮c-;＿sibilants＿⟯.
The »⟮hissing⟯« sibilants are ⟮alveolar⟯, the »⟮c-;hushing⟯« sibilants are ⟮postalveolar (or further back)⟯.
The »⟮hissing⟯« sibilants have an ⟮even higher⟯ ⟮pitch⟯ than the »⟮c_-2;hushing⟯« sibilants.

###### distinctive features

⟮＿Stridency＿⟯ is encoded in the distinctive feature ⟮[+/- strident]⟯.
⟮＿Sibilancy＿⟯ may sometimes be encoded in the distinctive feature ⟮[+/- sibilant]⟯

#### coarticulation

»⟮Co-articulation⟯« is having ⟮two or more simultaneous⟯ ⟮＿articulations＿⟯.
⟮＿Co-articulation＿⟯ may be ⟮＿double articulation＿⟯ or ⟮＿secondary articulation＿⟯.

##### secondary articulation

»⟮Secondary articulation⟯« is ⟮＿co-articulation＿⟯ where ⟮the second ＿place of artculation＿⟯ has ⟮a manner of approximant⟯.
⟮＿Secondary articulation＿⟯ is indicated in the IPA by ⟮superscripting⟯ the ⟮approximant version⟯ of ⟮the letter⟯
⟮Names⟯ for ⟮＿secondary articulation＿⟯ take ⟮the name of ＿the place of articulation＿⟯ and ⟮add -ization⟯.
e.g. labialization:［◌ʷ］, pharyngealization:［◌ˤ］, velarization:［◌ˠ］
⟮［ɫ］⟯is an exeption, indicating ⟮velarization or pharyngialization⟯.
Although the ⟮superscripting⟯ of a letter for ⟮＿secondary articulation＿⟯ seems to imply that it is simlar to ⟮the release diacritics⟯, in fact ⟮c_-;＿secondary articulation＿⟯ is ⟮simultaneous⟯ to the ⟮c_-2;＿primary articulation＿⟯.

##### double articulation

»⟮Double articulation⟯« is ⟮＿co-articulation＿⟯ whose ⟮places⟯ ⟮share the same manner⟯.

#### vowels

⟮＿Vowels＿⟯ are classified in ⟮the IPA⟯ by ⟮tongue height⟯, ⟮tongue backness⟯, and ⟮lip rounding⟯.
In fact it is not ⟮tongue height⟯ and ⟮c_;tongue backness⟯ but ⟮formant frequencies⟯ what the IPA/distinctive features end up describing.
⟮F1, F2, F3⟯ = ⟮first, second, third formant⟯


table:IPA classification|distictive feature
⟮tongue height⟯|⟮[+/- high/mid/low]⟯
⟮tongue backness⟯|⟮[+/- front/central/back]⟯
⟮lip rounding⟯|⟮[+/- labial/round]⟯

##### rhotacization

r-colored vowel = rhotic vowel (amongst other names)
»⟮A rhotic vowel⟯« is a vowel with ⟮a lower F3⟯.
⟮＿A rhotic vowel＿⟯ sounds (to english speakers) like there is ⟮an r present⟯.
In english orthography for ⟮american english⟯, ⟮a vowel grapheme⟯ + ⟮r grapheme⟯ frequently only indicates ⟮＿a rhotic vowel＿⟯ instead of ⟮an actual rhotic consonant⟯.
⟮＿rhotic vowels＿⟯ are ⟮uncommon⟯ ⟮crosslinguistically⟯, however they are ⟮c-;common⟯ in ⟮two of the most widely-spoken languages: american english and mandarin chinese⟯.
⟮＿rhotic vowels＿⟯ are indicated in the IPA by ⟮［◌˞］⟯ or by ⟮a superscript turned r ［ʴ］⟯

##### monopthongs/dipthongs

⟮＿Vowels＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿monopthongs＿⟯ or ⟮＿dipthongs＿⟯.
»⟮A monopthong⟯« is a vowel sound that ⟮stays the same during its articulation⟯.
»⟮A dipthong⟯« is a vowel sound that ⟮changes between two vowels during articulation⟯.
⟮＿A monopthong＿⟯ may be called a ⟮pure⟯, ⟮c-;＿a dipthong＿⟯ an ⟮impure⟯ vowels.
Since ⟮＿a dipthong＿⟯ ⟮changes from one vowel to another⟯, it may also be called ⟮a glide⟯.

#### relative articulation

»⟮Relative articulation⟯« is ⟮the modification⟯ of ⟮＿the articulation＿⟯ of a speech sound ⟮relative to some reference point⟯.
e.g. advanced/retracted, raised/lowered, centralized/mid-centralized and more rarely advanced/retracted tongue root

##### forms of relative articulation

⟮advanced⟯ = ⟮fronted⟯
⟮retracted⟯ = ⟮backed⟯
Something »⟮advanced/retracted⟯« is articulated ⟮farther to the front/back of the vocal tract⟯ than ⟮some reference point⟯. 
Something »⟮raised/lowered⟯« is articulated with ⟮＿the active articulator＿⟯ ⟮raised higher/lower⟯ than ⟮some reference point⟯
A »⟮centralized⟯« vowel is ⟮more central (front-back)⟯ than ⟮its referent vowel⟯.
A »⟮mid-centralized⟯« vowel is ⟮closer to the midpoint of the vowel space⟯ than ⟮its referent vowel⟯. 
»⟮advanced or retracted tongue root⟯« is ⟮the root of the tongue⟯ ⟮moving forward/backward⟯, ⟮expanding/shringking⟯ ⟮＿the pharyngeal cavity＿⟯.
A sound with ⟮＿retracted tongue root＿⟯ may also be seen as ⟮＿pharyngealized＿⟯.

##### IPA

The IPA diacritic for ⟮＿advanced/retracted＿⟯, ⟮＿raised/lowered＿⟯, ⟮＿advanced/retracted tongue root＿⟯ generally appears ⟮below⟯ ⟮the IPA symbol⟯, or to the ⟮c-;right⟯ of ⟮the IPA symbol⟯ if ⟮there is no more room⟯


table:relative articulation|IPA symbol
⟮advanced⟯|⟮［◌̟］⟯
⟮retracted⟯|⟮［◌̠］⟯
⟮raised⟯|⟮［◌̝］⟯
⟮lowered⟯|⟮［◌̞］⟯
⟮centered⟯|⟮［◌̈］⟯
⟮mid-centralized⟯|⟮［◌̽］⟯
⟮advanced tongue root⟯|⟮［◌̘］⟯
⟮retracted tongue root⟯|⟮［◌̙］⟯

## IPA

### general principles

Generally, if ⟮there is no 'room'⟯ ⟮beneath⟯ an IPA symbol, you place a diacritic that would normally go there ⟮above⟯ instead.

#### mnemonics

all retroflex phones feature a right-facing bottom hook in their IPA symbol
all phones written with variants of the h in the IPA are either epiglottal/pharyngeal or glottal, and are fricatives.
