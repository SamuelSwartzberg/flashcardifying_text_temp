# phonetics

»⟮Phonetics⟯« is a branch of linguistics that studies ⟮＿phones＿⟯.

⟮＿Phones＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿phonemes＿⟯ may be produced via ⟮＿speech＿⟯ or via ⟮c_;＿sign＿⟯.
»⟮A sign phone/phoneme⟯« (somewhat rare term) is ⟮＿a phone/phoneme＿⟯ ⟮produced via ＿sign＿⟯.
»⟮A speech phone/phoneme⟯« (somewhat rare term) is ⟮＿a phone/phoneme＿⟯ ⟮produced via ＿speech＿⟯.

»⟮A speech sound⟯« is ⟮＿a speech phone or phoneme＿⟯ where ⟮the classification into different phones⟯ is ⟮not at issue⟯.

## branches

⟮＿Phonetics＿⟯ is traditionally divided into ⟮＿articulatory＿⟯, ⟮＿acoustic＿⟯ and ⟮＿auditory＿⟯.
All of ⟮the three branches⟯ of ⟮＿phonetics＿⟯ are ⟮interested in ＿phones＿⟯ in ⟮different ways⟯.

# speech production 

## distinctive features

»⟮A natural class⟯« is ⟮a set of ＿phonemes＿⟯ in a language that ⟮share certain ＿distinctive features＿⟯.
⟮＿Distinctive features＿⟯ are typically grouped into ⟮＿major class features＿⟯, ⟮＿manner features＿⟯, ⟮＿place features＿⟯, and ⟮＿laryngeal features＿⟯.

## major class features

»⟮Major class features⟯« are a group of ⟮four⟯ ⟮＿distinctive features＿⟯ that ⟮share little in common⟯ ⟮＿phonetically＿⟯, but ⟮describe the overall type of a phoneme⟯.
⟮The four ＿major class features＿⟯ are ⟮[+/- syllabic]⟯, ⟮[+/- approximant]⟯, ⟮[+/- consonantal or eqivalently +/- vocalic]⟯, ⟮[+/- sonorant]⟯
⟮All ＿speech sounds＿⟯ ⟮have values⟯ for ⟮all of the four ＿major class features＿.⟯
Ergo, ⟮all ＿speech sounds＿⟯ are either ⟮＿syllabic＿⟯ or ⟮c_;not⟯, either ⟮＿approximants (wide sense)＿⟯ or ⟮c_;not⟯, either ⟮＿consonants＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿vowels＿⟯, either ⟮＿sonorants＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿obstruents＿⟯.

⟮＿Continuants＿⟯ contain ⟮all⟯ {⟮＿sonorants＿⟯, ⟮＿fricatives＿⟯}.
Ergo ⟮all⟯ ⟮＿sonorants＿⟯ are ⟮＿continuants＿⟯.
⟮＿Sonorants＿⟯ contain ⟮all⟯ {⟮＿approximants (wide sense)＿⟯, ⟮＿nasals＿⟯}.
Ergo ⟮all⟯ ⟮＿approximants＿⟯ are ⟮＿sonorants＿⟯.
⟮＿Approximants＿⟯ contain ⟮all⟯ {⟮＿syllabic sounds＿⟯, ⟮＿liquids＿⟯}.
Ergo ⟮all⟯ ⟮＿syllabic sounds＿⟯ are ⟮＿approximants＿⟯.
⟮＿Syllabic sounds＿⟯ contain ⟮all⟯ {⟮＿vowels＿⟯, ⟮＿semivowels＿⟯}.

### sonority

»⟮Sonority⟯« is roughly ⟮the relative loudness⟯ of ⟮＿a phone＿⟯.
⟮＿Sonority＿⟯ is defined via ⟮＿the sonority hierarchy＿⟯.
⟮＿Sonority＿⟯ mostly ⟮depends⟯ on ⟮＿the manner of articulation＿⟯.
The most basic ⟮＿sonority hierarchy＿⟯ is ⟮＿vowels＿⟯ > ⟮c_;＿consonants＿⟯
A prototypical »⟮sonority hierarchy⟯« may be ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;vowels⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;semivowels⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;liquids⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;nasals⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;voiced fricatives⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;voiceless fricatives⟯ ≈ ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;voiced obstruents⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;voiceless obstruents⟯.

#### !major classes (+ continuant) sorted by sonority of their contents

table:major class|types of sounds contained sorted by sonority
⟮vocalic⟯|⟮vowels⟯
⟮syllabic⟯|⟮vowels + semivowels⟯
⟮approximant⟯|⟮vowels + semivowels + liquids⟯
⟮sonorant⟯|⟮vowels + semivowels + liquids + nasals⟯
⟮continuant⟯|⟮vowels + semivowels + liquids + nasals + fricatives⟯

Ergo the distinctive features ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;vocalic⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;syllabic⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;approximant⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;sonorant⟯ > ⟮c+;s∞;us_-;continuant⟯ are progressively less strict about sonority.

### consonants

»⟮A consonant⟯« ⟮has an audible constriction⟯ of ⟮＿the vocal tract＿⟯.
»⟮A vowel⟯« ⟮does not have an audible constriction⟯ of ⟮＿the vocal tract＿⟯.
⟮Whether a speech sound is a ＿consonant＿ or ＿vowel＿⟯ is encoded by ⟮＿the distinctive feature＿ [+/- consonantal/vocalic]⟯
⟮＿the distinctive feature＿⟯ ⟮[+/- consonantal]⟯ is ⟮c-;the same as⟯ ⟮[-/+ vocalic]⟯, which one uses is ⟮c-;up to preference⟯.
⟮＿Consonants＿⟯ are categorized in the IPA by their ⟮＿manner＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿place＿⟯ of ⟮c_;＿articulation＿⟯ as well as their ⟮＿voicing＿⟯.

### sonorants & obstruents

»⟮A sonorant⟯« is ⟮＿a speech sound＿⟯ that is produced via ⟮＿airflow＿⟯ that is ⟮not obstructed⟯ ⟮at all⟯, or ⟮not to an extent sufficent to create turbulence⟯.
»⟮An obstruent⟯« is ⟮＿a speech sound＿⟯ that is produced via ⟮＿airflow＿⟯ that is ⟮obstructed⟯ ⟮completely⟯, or ⟮to an extent sufficent to create turbulence⟯.
Whether something ⟮is a ＿sonorant＿⟯ is encoded by ⟮＿the distinctive feature＿ [+sonorant]⟯
⟮Most⟯ ⟮＿sonorants＿⟯ are ⟮＿voiced＿⟯.
⟮＿Obstruents＿⟯ are either ⟮＿oral occlusives＿⟯, ⟮＿fricatives＿⟯ or ⟮＿affricates＿⟯.

### approximant

»⟮Approximants (wide sense)⟯« are those ⟮＿speech sounds＿⟯ that allow ⟮a (completely/mostly) frictionless airstream⟯ ⟮through the mouth⟯.
Whether something is ⟮＿an approximant in the wide sense＿⟯ is indicated by ⟮＿the distinctive feature＿ [+/- approximant]⟯.

#### Liquids

»⟮rhotics⟯« are ⟮a class of⟯ ⟮＿consonants＿⟯ that are ⟮r-like (a quality notoriously difficult to define further)⟯.
⟮＿Rhotics＿⟯ are transcribed in the IPA with ⟮variants of the roman letter r⟯.
»⟮Liquids⟯« are ⟮a class of⟯ ⟮＿consonants＿⟯.
»⟮Liquids⟯« consist of all ⟮＿rhotics＿⟯ and ⟮voiced lateral appoximants⟯.
⟮＿Liquids＿⟯ are grouped amongst other things because they often behave similar ⟮＿phonotactically＿⟯.

### syllabic

»⟮Syllabic sounds⟯« are those which ⟮form ＿the nucleus＿ of ＿the syllable＿⟯.
⟮＿Syllabic sounds＿⟯ are indicated by ⟮＿the distinctive feature＿ [+syllabic]⟯

#### semivowels

Phonologically, »⟮a semivowel⟯« is ⟮a ＿non-syllabic＿ ＿vowel＿ ([-syllabic] [+vocalic])⟯.
Ergo ⟮＿a semivowel＿⟯ acts as ⟮a ＿coda＿ or ＿onset＿⟯.
Phonetically, ⟮＿semivowels＿⟯ may ⟮be distinguished from⟯ ⟮＿vowels＿⟯ by the fact that ⟮they are one step lower on ＿the sonority hierarchy＿⟯.

#### syllabic consonants

Phonologically, »⟮a syllabic consonant⟯« is ⟮a ＿syllabic＿ ＿consonant＿ ([+syllabic] [+consonantal])⟯.
Ergo ⟮＿a syllabic consonant＿⟯ acts as ⟮＿a nucleus＿⟯.
Generally, ⟮＿syllabic consonants＿⟯ are still ⟮＿sonorants＿⟯, as ⟮they still require their ＿onset＿ and ＿coda＿ to be lower on ＿the sonority hierarchy＿⟯

#### !IPA

⟮＿A semivowel＿⟯ is indicated ⟮［◌̯］⟯.
^Since it's sad.
⟮＿A syllabic consonant＿⟯ is indicated ⟮［◌̩］⟯ or ⟮c_;［◌̍］⟯

## phonetic production

»⟮Phonetic production⟯« (my coinage) is ⟮the ＿expression＿ stage (cf. fundamental concepts > what is language > language production)⟯ of ⟮＿speech production＿⟯, where ⟮actual sound is produced⟯.
⟮＿Phonetic production＿⟯ occurs in ⟮three⟯ ⟮sequential⟯ ⟮steps⟯.
⟮The three sequential steps of ＿phonetic production＿⟯ are ⟮＿initiation＿⟯, ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ and ⟮＿articulation＿⟯.
For ⟮＿phonetic production＿⟯, ⟮＿initiation＿⟯ ⟮produces the ＿airstream＿⟯, which is then ⟮shaped⟯ via ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ and ⟮＿articulation＿⟯.

### exceptions

»⟮Percussive consonants⟯« are ⟮＿consonants＿⟯ produced by ⟮two ＿articulators＿ striking each other⟯.
⟮＿Percussive consonants＿⟯ don't have ⟮＿initiation＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿phonation＿⟯, only ⟮c_;＿articulartion＿⟯.

### initiation

»⟮The airsteam⟯« is ⟮the stream of air⟯ which ⟮eventually becomes the sound⟯.

»⟮The air direction⟯« (somewhat rare term) is ⟮the direction of ＿the airstream＿⟯.
»⟮The airstream mechanism⟯« is how the airstream is generated.
»⟮The airstream mechanism⟯« is defined by the choice of ⟮＿initiator＿⟯ and ⟮＿air direction＿⟯.
The airstream mechanism's initator may be defined by a set of adjectives corresponding to the initiator.

#### !initiators

There are four actual airstream mechanisms.
⟮Lingual/velaric egressive⟯ and ⟮pulmonic ingressive⟯ are ⟮＿the hypothetical default inititator airstream mechanisms＿⟯ which are ⟮not used in natural languages⟯.
pulmonic is commonly used for pulmonic egressive (for obvious reasons, see amobe)
The actual airstream mechanims are often divided into pulmonic egressive and non-pulmonic.
⟮＿Non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms＿⟯ are ⟮glottalic egressive⟯, ⟮glottalic ingressive⟯ and ⟮velaric/lingual ingressive⟯.

The ⟮frontmost⟯ ⟮＿closure point＿⟯ of ⟮＿all closures＿⟯ is always ⟮created by ＿(an) articulator(s)＿⟯.
For ⟮＿non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms＿⟯, to produce ⟮＿the airflow＿⟯, there must be ⟮＿a closure＿⟯, ⟮one of whose ＿closure points＿⟯ is ⟮then released⟯.
For ⟮＿non-pulmonic＿⟯ ⟮＿ingressive＿⟯ sounds, ⟮between⟯ ⟮＿the two closure points＿⟯ something is ⟮lowered⟯ to ⟮c_;create low pressure (suction)⟯, and then the ⟮second⟯ ⟮c_-2;＿closure point＿⟯ is ⟮released⟯.
For ⟮＿non-pulmonic＿⟯ ⟮＿egressive＿⟯ sounds, ⟮between⟯ ⟮＿the two closure points＿⟯ something is ⟮raised⟯ to ⟮c_;create high pressure⟯, and then the ⟮first⟯ ⟮c_-2;＿closure point＿⟯ is ⟮released⟯.
⟮＿Non-pulmonic airstream mechanisms＿⟯ always produce ⟮＿obstruents＿⟯.

###### glottalic

In ⟮＿glottalic＿ ＿airstream mechanisms＿⟯, the ⟮second⟯ ⟮＿closure point＿⟯ is produced by ⟮＿the glottis＿⟯.

⟮＿Phonation＿⟯ may sometimes more narrowly refer to ⟮＿voicing＿⟯.
The distinctive features related to ⟮＿phonation＿⟯ are the ⟮＿laryngeal distinctive features＿⟯.
There are ⟮three⟯ ⟮＿laryngeal distinctive features.＿⟯
⟮The three ＿laryngeal distinctive features＿⟯ are ⟮[+/- voiced]⟯, ⟮[+/- aspirated AKA spread glottis]⟯, ⟮[+/- glottalized AKA constricted glottis]⟯

##### aspiration

»⟮Aspiration⟯« when ⟮＿the vocal folds＿⟯ ⟮remain open⟯ ⟮after a sound is produced⟯.
ergo ⟮[+spread glottis]⟯ for the purposes of ⟮＿aspiration＿⟯ means that ⟮the vocal folds remain open⟯ ⟮⁑after⁑ the articulation⟯.
Since ⟮aspiration works somewhat differently⟯ from⟮ other [+spread glottis] feature⟯s, sometimes ⟮[+aspiration]⟯ is used.
⟮＿Aspiration＿⟯ is indicated in the ipa via ⟮［◌ʰ］⟯
⟮＿Aspiration＿⟯ feels like ⟮a little burst of air⟯ to the speaker.

There are three ⟮＿tongue articulator parts＿⟯: ⟮coronal⟯, ⟮dorsal⟯, and ⟮radical⟯
Ergo ⟮＿coronal＿⟯, ⟮＿dorsal＿⟯ and ⟮＿radical＿⟯ active places of articulation are articulated with ⟮the tongue⟯ as ⟮＿the active articulator＿⟯.
»⟮Labial⟯« is an active place of articulation supercategory articulated with ⟮the lips⟯ as ⟮＿the active articulator＿⟯ and thus also the active place of articulation.
Pharyngeal is an active place of articulation supercategory articulated with the pharynx as the active articulator and thus also the active place of articulation.
Coronal is an active place of articulation supercategory articulated with the front part of the tongue as the active place of articulation.
Dorsal is an active place of articulation supercategory articulated with the body of the tongue as the active place of articulation.
Radical is an active place of articulation supercategory articulated with the root/base of the tongue as the active place of articulation.
»⟮The active place of articulation supercategory⟯« (my term) is either ⟮＿the active articulator＿ involved (if not tongue)⟯, or ⟮＿the tongue articulator part＿⟯.

There are two forms of ⟮＿rounding＿⟯, ⟮＿protruded rounding＿⟯ and ⟮＿compressed rounding＿⟯.
In »⟮protruded rounding⟯«, ⟮the lips⟯ ⟮push⟯ ⟮out of the face⟯ ⟮c_;to produce the ＿rounding＿⟯.
In »⟮compressed rounding⟯«, ⟮the lips⟯ ⟮push⟯ ⟮onto each other⟯ ⟮c_;and do not push out to produce ＿rounding＿⟯.
⟮There are no dedicated⟯ ⟮IPA diacritics⟯ to represent the distinction between ⟮＿compressed and protruded rounding＿⟯.
In absence of a dedicated IPA letter, ⟮［◌ᵝ］⟯ or ⟮［◌ᶹ］⟯ are sometimes used for ⟮＿compressed rounding＿⟯.
In absence of a dedicated IPA letter, ⟮［◌ʷ］⟯ is sometimes used for ⟮＿protruded rounding＿⟯.

###### distinctive features

Sounds with a ⟮＿coronal＿⟯ ⟮＿active place of articulation supercategory＿⟯ that have ⟮＿a dental, prealveolar or alveolar＿⟯ ⟮＿passive place of articulation＿⟯ have the distinctive feature ⟮[+anterior]/[-posterior]⟯
Sounds with a ⟮＿coronal＿⟯ ⟮＿active place of articulation supercategory＿⟯ that have a ⟮＿postalveolar＿⟯ ⟮＿passive place of articulation＿⟯ have the distinctive feature ⟮[-anterior]/[+posterior]⟯

###### details

»⟮Retroflex⟯« (strong) is when ⟮the tongue is curled⟯, which generally means ⟮＿subapical＿⟯ and ⟮＿palatal＿ (ggf ＿postalveolar＿)⟯.
»⟮Retroflex⟯« (weak/technically not) is ⟮＿apical＿⟯ ⟮＿postalveolar＿⟯.
⟮The difference between⟯ ⟮＿dental＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿denti-alveolar＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿alveolar＿⟯ ⟮＿places of articulation＿⟯ is generally not ⟮＿phonemic＿⟯
The larger group ⟮＿dental＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿denti-alveolar＿⟯, ⟮＿alveolar＿⟯ may also be called »⟮alveolar (in the larger sense)⟯«.
The IPA only has ⟮different symbols for⟯ ⟮＿dental, denti-alveolar and alveolar＿⟯ for ⟮＿fricatives＿⟯

#### manner of articulation

Featurally, the ⟮＿manner of articulation＿⟯ is described by ⟮5⟯ ⟮＿manner distinctive features＿⟯.
⟮The 5 ＿manner distinctive features＿⟯ are ⟮[+/- continuant]⟯, ⟮[+/- nasal]⟯, ⟮[+/- strident]⟯, ⟮[+/- lateral]⟯, ⟮[+/- delayed release]⟯.

##### continuant

In all cases, ⟮stop⟯ is a synonym to ⟮occlusive⟯.
An occlusive is a sound that obstructs airflow anywhere but the nose.
⟮＿A continuant＿⟯ is the opposite of ⟮＿an occlusive＿⟯.
Whether something is ⟮＿a continuant or occlusive＿⟯ is indicated by the distinctive feature ⟮[+/- continuant]⟯.
⟮Oral stop/occlusive⟯ may be shortened to ⟮stop/occlusive⟯, but this is confusing, so I won't.

###### release

The release release (my term) of an occlusive is when the articulators are separated.
The only-maybe-release (my term) of an occlusive is when the next phone starts, no matter if the articulators don't cease to make contact.
Release is ambiguous between release release and only-maybe-release
A sound with a silent release (my term) has a release release that is silent.
A sound with a no release (my term) has no release release, only a only-maybe-release, instead transitioning without release to the next phone.
A no release must generally be homorganic.
No audible release is ambiguous between silent release and no release.
A lateral release is a no release where the next phone is a lateral sound.
A nasal release is a no release where the next phone is a nasal sound.
Any occlusive can be only-maybe-released in a variety of ways.

####### affricate

An affricate is a stop with a release release as a fricative, or equivalently, a no release into a fricative.
Whether something is an affricate is indicated by the disinctive feature [+/- delayed release]
Affricates in the IPA are indicated by two symbols united by a tie on top or more rarely at the bottom.
p͡f, t͡ɕ etc.

####### IPA

table:name|symbol
no audible release|［◌̚］, e.g. ［p̚］
nasal release|superscript of the relevant nasal stop, e.g. ［◌ⁿ］
lateral release|［◌ˡ］

##### nasals 

A nasal is one where velum is lowered to allow air to escape through the nose.
Whether a sound is nasal is indicated by the distinctive feature [+/-] nasal
To indicate a nasal sound for which there is no dedicated ipa letter, ［◌̃］ is used.

##### occlusive + nasal

###### oral occlusive

An oral occlusive is [-continuant] [-nasal]. (i.e. an oral closure with no lowered velum)
Oral occlusives may also be called plosives.
Oral occlusives without an audible release may sometimes be called applosives.
Oral occlusive may be shortened to stop/occlusive, but this is confusing, so I won't.

####### implosives

Implosives are always oral occlusives.
Implosives are most often voiced.

###### nasal occlusive

A nasal occlusive is [-continuant] [+nasal]. (i.e. an oral closure with lowered velum)
Nasal occlusive may be shortened to nasal, but this is confusing, so I won't.

##### lateral consonants

A lateral is a sound in which the airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. 
Whether something is lateral is described by the distinctive feature [+/- lateral]
Manners of consonants that can become lateral are fricatives/affricates, approximants, taps/flaps and clicks.

##### approximants

Approximants are those sounds that have some narrowing but still allow a frictionless escape of air.

Approximants (narrow) sense fall between fricatives and vowels.

##### fricatives

Fricatives produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together.
Fricatives are a type of obstruent consonant.
frication is the turbulent airflow produced for the formation of fricatives.
Stridents are a subset of fricatives where additionally a stream of air is directed by the tongue towards the teeth.
The sound produced by stridents is in higher amplitude and pitch.
Sibilants are a further subset of stridents.
Stridency is encoded in the distinctive feature [+/- strident].
Sibilancy may sometimes be encoded in the distinctive feature [+/- sibilant]


#### coarticulation

Co-articulated sounds are produced with two or more simultaneous articulations.
Co-articulated sounds may be doubly articulated sounds or sounds with secondary articulation.

##### secondary articulation

Secondary articulation is co-articulated sound where the second place of artculation has a manner of approximant.
Secondary articulation is indicated in the IPA by superscripting the approximant version of the letter, where the place indicated by the superscript is the place which is articulated with the manner of approximant.
Names for secondary articulation take the name of the passive place of articulation and add -ization.
e.g. labialization:［◌ʷ］, pharyngealization:［◌ˤ］, velarization:［◌ˠ］
［ɫ］is an exeption, indicating velarization or pharyngialization.
Although the superscripting of a letter for secondary articulation seems to imply that it is simlar to the release diacritics which also use superscripts, in fact secondary articulation is simultaneous to the primary articulation.

##### doubly articulated cononants

Doubly articulated sounds are are co-articulated sounds whose places share the same manner.

#### vowels

Vowels are classified ⟮by the IPA⟯ by ⟮tongue height⟯, ⟮tongue backness⟯, and ⟮lip rounding⟯.
In fact it is not tongue height and tongue backness but formant frequencies what the IPA/distinctive features end up describing.
the vowel written ə is called schwa
F1, F2, F3 = first, second, third formant


table:IPA classification|distictive feature
tongue height|[+/- high/mid/low]
tongue backness|[+/- front/central/back]
lip rounding|[+/- labial/round]

##### rhotacization

r-colored vowel = rhotic vowel (amongst other names)
On a physical level, a rhotic vowel has a lower F3.
In american english, an r following a vowel frequently only indicates a rhotic vowel.
rhotic vowels are uncommon crosslinguistically.
However, rhotic vowels are common in two of the most widely-spoken languages: american english and mandarin chinese.
rhotic vowels are indicated in the IPA by ［◌˞］ or by a superscript turned r ［ʴ］

##### monopthongs/dipthongs

Monopthong and dipthong are two kinds of vowels often distinguished.
A monopthong is a vowel sound that stays the same during its articulation.
A dipthong is a vowel sound that changes between two vowels during articulation.
A monopthong may be called a pure, a dipthong an impure vowels.
Since a dipthong changes from one vowel to another, it may also be called a glide.

#### relative articulation

Relative articulation is the modification of the articulation of a phone relative to some reference point.
e.g. advanced/retracted, raised/lowered, centralized/mid-centralized and more rarely advanced/retracted tongue root

##### forms of relative articulation

advanced = fronted
retracted = backed
An advanced/retracted sound is one that is pronounced farther to the front/back of the vocal tract than some reference point. 
A raised/lowered sound is articulated with the active articulator raised higher/lower than some reference point
A centralized vowel is a vowel that is more central (front-back) than some point of reference.
Mid-centralized vowels are closer to the midpoint of the vowel space than their referent vowels. 
A sound with advanced or retracted tongue root has the root of the tongue move forward/backward, expanding/shringking the pharyngeal cavity.
A sound with retracted tongue root may also be seen as pharyngealized.

##### IPA

The IPA diacritic for advanced/retracted, raised/lowered, advanced/retracted tongue root generally appears below the IPA symbol.
The IPA diacritic for advanced/retracted, raised/lowered, advanced/retracted tongue root generally appears to the right of the IPA symbol if there is no more room


table:relative articulation|IPA symbol
advanced|［◌̟］
retracted|［◌̠］
raised|［◌̝］ 
lowered|［◌̞］
centered|［◌̈］
mid-centralized|［◌̽］
Advanced Tongue Root|［◌̘］
Retracted Tongue Root|［◌̙］

### IPA

#### general principles

If there is no 'room' beneath an IPA symbol, you place a diacritic that would normally go there above instead.

###### mnemonics

The alveolar click is the only one that uses a punctiation mark as an IPA symbol.


##### mnemonics

all retroflex phones feature a right-facing bottom hook in their IPA symbol
all phones written with variants of the h in the IPA are either epiglottal/pharyngeal or glottal, and are fricatives.

Both the velar and uvular voiceleess fricative are based in their IPA spelling on the x.
Uvular trill and fricative both feature variants of the smallcaps R as their IPA symbols.
phones with a c in their IPA symbol all have a passive place of articulation of palatal, and are voiceless.
In general, phones with greek IPA symbols are similar to phones with the same letter as a latin letter.
all uvular voiced sounds have small-caps IPA symbols

##### glottalic consonants

implosives are marked by the IPA via a right-facing hook on top of the symbol for the relevant equivalent oral occlusive, e.g. ［ɓ］ or ［ɗ］
ejectives are marked by the IPA via ［ʼ］, e.g. ［qʼ］

The near-close are most commonly also only near-back/near-front (instead of fully so like shown in the able)
Near front near close vowel's IPA symbols are smallcaps versions of the front close ones.
For the IPA vowel chart, further down more open and further up more closed since it describes tngue height relative to the top of the mouth, at least in theory.
The unrounded version of the back closed vowel is double the u compared the rounded version of the back closed vowel.
the IPA vowels spelled wit oe/E ligatures are both front and both rounded.
ɶ is lower in the vowel chart than œ.
The rounded near-back near-close vowel looks like the ひ kana.

»⟮The length⟯« of a phone is ⟮its extension in time⟯ ⟮relative to⟯ other phones.
⟮［◌ˑ］⟯ indicates something that is ⟮half-length⟯.
⟮［◌̆］⟯ indicates something that is ⟮extra-short⟯.
⟮［◌ː］⟯ indicates something that is ⟮longer/lengthened⟯.

### gemination

»⟮Gemination⟯« is ⟮the lengthening⟯ of ⟮＿consonants＿⟯.
»⟮A geminate⟯« is ⟮＿a consonant＿⟯ ⟮exhibiting gemination⟯.
»⟮A singleton⟯« is ⟮not ＿a geminate＿ (i.e. regular length)⟯
In many alphabets, ⟮＿geminates＿⟯ are written with ⟮doubled letters⟯.
⟮＿Oral occlusives＿⟯ experience ⟮＿gemination＿⟯ by ⟮holding the closure⟯.
⟮＿Nasal occlusives＿⟯ and ⟮＿continuants (which contain vowels, though it is rarely called ⟮s_+;gemination⟯ for vowels)＿⟯ experience ⟮＿gemination＿⟯ by ⟮lengthening of the sound⟯.
