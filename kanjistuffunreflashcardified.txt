Cursive variants of 漢字 have way less strokes than non-cursive variants.
Often, cursive variants of 漢字 are nearly illegible, even for native speakers.
However, cursive variants are very quick to write.
Cursive variants are generally generated by merging strokes.
The easiest/most common way to merge strokes for 漢字 is to merge dots into a single stroke.
The two scripts considered {{c3::cursive}} are {{c1::行書}} and {{c2::草書}}
