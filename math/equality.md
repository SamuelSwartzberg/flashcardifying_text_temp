»⟮An equality⟯« is ⟮＿a relation＿⟯ between ⟮two ＿expressional well-formed formulae＿⟯ asserting that ⟮they have the same value⟯ or ⟮represent the same mathematical object⟯.
»⟮An identity⟯« asserts ⟮＿an equality＿⟯ ⟮for all values⟯ of ⟮the variables contained, at least for the domain.⟯
⟮Conditional⟯ =syn= ⟮conditional equation⟯
»⟮A conditional⟯« asserts ⟮＿an equality＿⟯ ⟮only for particular values⟯ of ⟮the variables contained⟯.

## equations

»⟮An equation⟯« expresses ⟮＿an equality＿⟯ ⟮between two expressional well-formed formulae⟯ by ⟮connecting them with the equals sign⟯.
⟮＿An equation＿⟯ is ⟮ambiguous between⟯ ⟮expressing⟯ ⟮＿a conditional＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿an identity＿⟯. 

### anatomy

The left/right-hand side are the expressional wffs on the left/right-hand side of an equation.

### solutions

A unknown is a variable of an equation for which a solution is desired.
A solution is a value for an unknown which makes a conditional equation true.
The solution set is the set of all solutions for an equation.
Solving an equation is determining the solution set.

#### types of solutions

A solution may be a numeric solution or a symbolic solution.
A numeric solution is a solution which is a number.
A symbolic solution is a solution which is an expressional wff.

#### derived things

A contradiction⎵equation⎵ is an equation with no solution.

### systems

A equation set is a set of equations.
A system of equations is an equation set involving the same variables.
A solution to a system of equations is a solution to each equation in the equation set.
A linear/quadratic/cubic/polynomial system is a system of equations where the equations in the equation set are linear/quadratic/cubic/polynomial equations.

### polynomial

Algebraic equation =syn= polynomial equation.
A polynomial equation is an equation that can be rearranged to P = 0.
A linear/quadratic/cubic equation is an univariate equation that can be rearranged to linear/quadratic/cubic polynomial in standard form = 0.

#### algebraic solutions

An algebraic solution is a symbolic solution for a polynomial equation which is a closed-form expression.
There exists algebraic solutions for all polynomic equations with a degree ≤ 4, but not for all &gt; 4

#### cartesian equations

A cartesian equation is a polynomial equation containing two unknowns whose solutions are interpreted as cartesian coordinates.
A linear/quadratic/cubic cartesian equation (my term) is a linear/quadratic/cubic equation, but = y.

#### linear

A linear equation produces a line.
linear algebra is concerned with linear equations.

#### quadratic

ax⎴2⎴+bx+c 
A quadratic equation produces a parabola.

##### parabolae

The parabola's vertex is the point at which it intersects its axis of symmetry.

The graphing form (my term) of a quadratic equation is y=a(x-h)⎴2⎴+k, where the vertex is the point (h, k).
In the graphing form, if a is positive/negative, the parabola opens upwards/downwards.
What I call graphing form is confusingly often called standard form

##### solving

###### quadratic formula

The quadratic formula is the formula that produces the zeroes for a quadratic cartesian equation.
The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± sqrt(b⎴2⎴4ac))/2a

###### factor form
