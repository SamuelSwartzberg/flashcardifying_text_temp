# variables

»⟮A variable⎵wide⎵⟯« is ⟮a placeholder for something that may change⟯.
⟮＿A variable⎵wide⎵＿⟯ is ⟮＿a variable⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ or ⟮＿an indeterminate＿⟯.
»⟮A constant term⟯« is ⟮＿a term＿⟯ with ⟮no variable⎵wide⎵⟯.

## indeterminates

»⟮an indeterminate⟯« is ⟮a symbol⟯ that ⟮stands only for itself⟯, acting as ⟮a placeholder for explaining something⟯.

## free and bound

⟮＿A variable⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ may be ⟮＿free＿：f...⟯ or ⟮c_;＿bound＿⟯.
»⟮a free variable⟯« is one ⟮on which the value of an expression⟯ ⟮depends/says something about⟯
»⟮a bound variable⟯« is ⟮just a convenience to express something⟯
There are a few common ⟮variable-binding⟯ operators, most commonly ⟮sum Σ, product Π, integral ∫, limit lim, existential quantifier ∃, universal quantifier ∀⟯

## arguments, parameters, coefficients, constants

### !arguments, parameters

⟮＿A variable⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ may either be ⟮＿an argument＿⟯ or ⟮c_;＿a parameter＿⟯.
Often, ⟮variable⟯ is treated as a synonym for ⟮argument⟯ (only), ⟮but this is incorrect⟯.
»⟮An argument⟯« is ⟮＿a variable⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ that is ⟮the input of the function, that if varied produces different outcomes⟯.
»⟮A parameter⟯« is ⟮＿a variable⎵narrow⎵＿⟯ that is ⟮not provided as an input for the function⟯. 
Instead, functions with ⟮＿parameters＿⟯ produce ⟮families of functions⟯, where ⟮varying the parameter⟯ ⟮selects a function from⟯ ⟮c_-2;the family of functions⟯.
^By analogy: The speed of a bike depends on how fast one pedals - this is an argument. The speed of a bike also depends on the shape, weight, etc. of the bike - but varying those, you now have a different bike - this is a parameter. Leaving parameters for shape, weight, etc. of a bike undefined defines all possible relations between pedal speed and speed of the bike.
⟮＿The arguments＿⟯ but not ⟮c_;＿the parameters＿⟯ of a function are ⟮listed in f(...)：notation⟯
⟮＿Arguments＿⟯ are typically indicated by ⟮letters starting with x⟯.
⟮＿Parameters＿⟯ are typically indicated by ⟮letters starting with a⟯.

### coefficients, constants

»⟮A mathematical constant⟯« is a ⟮non-changing⟯ ⟮well-defined mathematical object⟯.
Examples for mathematical constants: π, e
»⟮Constant⟯« is ⟮ambiguous between⟯ ⟮＿mathematical constant＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿parameter＿⟯
»⟮A coefficient⟯« is ⟮＿a factor＿⟯ of ⟮＿a term＿⟯.
»⟮A constant coefficient⟯« is ⟮＿a coefficient＿⟯ where ⟮the other ＿factor＿ in ＿the term＿⟯ is ⟮1⟯.
