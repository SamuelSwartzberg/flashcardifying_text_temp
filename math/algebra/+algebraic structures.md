# algebraic structures

»⟮abstract algebra⟯« is ⟮the branch of⟯ ⟮＿algebra＿⟯ concerned with ⟮algebraic structures⟯.
»⟮An algebraic structure⟯« is the combination of ⟮＿a carrier set＿⟯, ⟮＿the structure operations＿⟯, and ⟮＿the structure axioms＿⟯.
»⟮The carrier set⟯« is a ⟮nonemtpy⟯ ⟮＿set＿⟯ of ⟮＿an algebraic structure＿⟯.
»⟮The structure operations⟯« (my term) are a collection of ⟮finitary⟯ ⟮＿operations＿⟯ on ⟮＿the carrier set＿⟯.
»⟮The structure axioms⟯« (my term) are a ⟮finite⟯ ⟮＿set＿ of ＿axioms＿⟯ of ⟮＿an algebraic structure＿⟯.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 

## fields

»⟮a field⟯« is ⟮＿an algebraic structure＿⟯ on which ⟮＿the elementary arithmetic operations＿⟯ are ⟮defined⟯ and ⟮behave as they do on real numbers⟯.
