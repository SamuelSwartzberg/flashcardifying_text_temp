#### binomial

##### binomial coeficient

The binomial coefficients are the positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem.
A binomial coefficient is the amount of k-combinations of n
^i.e. the amount of subsets of size k of a set with size n.

###### n=2

(a+b)⎴2⎴ = a⎴2⎴+2ab+b⎴2⎴
(a-b)⎴2⎴ = a⎴2⎴-2ab+b⎴2⎴
