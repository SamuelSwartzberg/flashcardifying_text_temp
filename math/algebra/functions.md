# functions

»⟮A function⟯« is ⟮a relationship between⟯ ⟮two sets⟯, ⟮＿the domain＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿the codomain＿⟯.
»⟮A function⟯« ⟮assigns⟯ ⟮an element of⟯ »⟮the codomain⟯« ⟮c-2;to⟯ ⟮each element of⟯ »⟮the domain⟯«. 
^this however does not imply that each element of the codomain is assigned to an element of the domain, there may be unassignemd elements
»⟮An argument⟯« is a value that ⟮must be provided⟯ to ⟮＿the function＿⟯ to ⟮obtain its result⟯.
»⟮A function⟯« takes ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮＿arguments＿⟯

## notation

⟮＿functions＿⟯ are most often indicated by ⟮the letter f and beyond⟯.
⟮f(x)⟯ indicates ⟮the value⟯ ⟮＿a function＿ yields⟯ for ⟮a given element of the ＿domain＿ x⟯.
⟮y⟯ represents ⟮the element of ＿the codomain＿⟯ that ⟮＿a function＿ yields⟯ for ⟮a specific element of the ＿domain＿⟯.

### pronunciation

`f(x)` is read 「⟮f of x⟯」 in english
`f(x)` is read 「⟮f von x⟯」 in german

## sets

### images

»⟮the image⟯« of ⟮＿a subset＿ of ＿the domain＿⟯ is ⟮＿the subset＿ of ＿the codomain＿⟯ that contains ⟮all values ＿the function＿ can produce⟯ for ⟮＿a subset＿ of ＿the domain＿.⟯
⟮＿the image＿⟯ of ⟮＿a function＿ = ＿the domain＿⟯ is ⟮＿the subset＿ of ＿the codomain＿⟯ that represents ⟮all values f(x) ＿the function＿ can produce (for the whole ＿domain＿)⟯.
»⟮The range⟯« of ⟮＿a function＿⟯ is ⟮ambiguous between⟯ ⟮＿the image＿ or ＿the codomain＿⟯.
⟮Inverse image⟯ = ⟮preimage⟯
»⟮the preimage⟯« of ⟮a given ＿image＿⟯ is ⟮＿the subset＿ of ＿the domain＿⟯ ⟮whose elements map onto values⟯ that are ⟮part of ＿the image＿⟯.
⟮＿The preimage＿⟯ of ⟮＿the image＿ of the whole ＿function/domain＿⟯ is ⟮the whole ＿domain＿⟯.
if the function is `f(x)=x⎴2⎴`, then ⟮＿the preimage＿⟯ of {1,4} for this function is ⟮{−2,−1,1,2}⟯

### graph

»⟮The graph⟯« of the function is ⟮the set of⟯ ⟮all pairs (x, f(x)) (equivalently: (x,y))⟯.

## types of functions

### jective

»⟮Jectivity⟯« encodes the relations between ⟮＿functions'＿⟯ ⟮＿domain＿⟯ and ⟮c_;＿codomain＿⟯.
as regards ⟮＿jectivity＿⟯, a function may be ⟮＿injective＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿surjective＿⟯, ⟮c_;＿bijective＿⟯ or ⟮c_;ø⟯.
⟮injective, surjective, bijective function⟯ = ⟮injection, surjection, bijection⟯
a function is »⟮injective⟯« if it ⟮maps each x⟯ ⟮to a distinct f(x)⟯,
More formally, a function is »⟮injective⟯« if ⟮f(x1) = f(x2)⟯ → ⟮x1 = x2⟯.
a function is »⟮surjective⟯« if for any y it ⟮has at least one mapping⟯ that ⟮produces y⟯
More formally, a function is »⟮surjective⟯« if ⟮(∀y)(∃x)⟯⟮f(x) = y⟯.
⟮＿The image＿⟯ of ⟮＿a surjective function＿⟯ is equivalent to ⟮＿its codomain＿⟯.
a function is »⟮bijective⟯« if it is ⟮both ＿injective＿ and ＿surjective＿⟯.
In other words, a function is »⟮bijective⟯« if it ⟮maps⟯ ⟮exactly one element⟯ of ⟮＿the domain＿⟯ ⟮c-2;to⟯ ⟮exactly one element⟯ of ⟮＿the codomain＿⟯.

## unary operations on functions

### inverse function

»⟮the inverse⟯« of ⟮＿a function＿　f⟯ is ⟮＿a function＿⟯ that ⟮undoes the operation of f⟯ and thus ⟮c_;yields the input⟯.
^thus this is different from the reciprocal/multiplicative invers, which yields the multiplicative identity 1.
⟮＿the inverse＿⟯ of a function f ⟮only exists⟯ if f is ⟮＿bijective＿⟯
⟮＿the inverse＿⟯ of a function f is denoted by ⟮f⎴-1⎴⟯

## properties of functions

### monotony

⟮monotonically increasing/decreasing⟯ may also be called ⟮non-de/increasing⟯ or ⟮weakly increasing/decreasing.⟯
⟮strictly monotonically increasing/decreasing⟯ may also be called ⟮strictly increasing/decreasing⟯ or just ⟮increasing/decreasing⟯.

A function is »⟮montonically increasing⟯« if ⟮∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵)⟯ ⟮x⎵1⎵ ≤ x⎵2⟯⎵ → ⟮f(x⎵1⎵) ≤ f(x⎵2⎵)⟯
A function is »⟮strictly montonically increasing⟯« if ⟮∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵)⟯ ⟮x⎵1⎵ ‹ x⎵2⎵⟯ → ⟮f(x⎵1⎵) ‹ f(x⎵2⎵)⟯
A function is »⟮montonically decreasing⟯« if ⟮∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵)⟯ ⟮x⎵1⎵ ≤ x⎵2⎵⟯ → ⟮f(x⎵1⎵) ≥ f(x⎵2⎵)⟯
A function is »⟮strictly montonically decreasing⟯« if ⟮∀(x⎵1⎵, x⎵2⎵)⟯ ⟮x⎵1⎵ ‹ x⎵2⎵⟯ → ⟮f(x⎵1⎵) › f(x⎵2⎵)⟯

a function is »⟮monotonic⟯« if it is ⟮＿monotonically increasing＿⟯ or ⟮＿monotonically decresing＿⟯
a function is »⟮strictly monotonic⟯« if it is ⟮＿strictly monotonically increasing＿ or ＿stricly monotonically decresing＿⟯

### zero

⟮Zero⟯ =syn= ⟮null⟯ =syn= ⟮root⟯
⟮Nullstelle⟯ =trans= ⟮zero/null/root⟯
»⟮The zero⟯« is ⟮the point at which⟯ ⟮＿the graph＿ of ＿a function＿⟯ ⟮touches or intersects with⟯ ⟮the x-axis⟯
Per definition, any ⟮＿zero＿ x⟯ has the property ⟮f(x)=0⟯
