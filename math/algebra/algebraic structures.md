# algebraic structure

»⟮abstract algebra⟯« is ⟮the branch of⟯ ⟮＿algebra＿⟯ concerned with ⟮algebraic structures⟯.
For edification, but not currently study material:
In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. 

## fields

a field is an algebraic structure which is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do.
