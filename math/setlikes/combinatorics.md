# combinatorics

»⟮Combinatorics⟯« is ⟮the branch of⟯ mathematics, most commonly of ⟮＿discrete mathematics＿⟯, concerned with ⟮problems of selection and arragement within finite or discrete systems⟯.

## factorial

»⟮The factorial⟯« of n is ⟮`Π⎵i=1⎵⎴n⎴i`⟯.
⟮＿the factorial＿⟯ is indicated by the operator ⟮!⟯
Factorials only make sense for ⟮non-negative integers：which numbers?⟯.

## !⟮h+;enumerative combinatorics⟯

»⟮Enumerative combinatorics⟯« is the area/branch of ⟮＿combinatorics＿⟯ concerned with ⟮the numbers of ways that certain patterns can be formed⟯.

### ation

»⟮An ation⟯« (my term) of a set S is ⟮＿a subset＿ (ordered or unordered) of S⟯.
»⟮A k-ation⟯« is ⟮＿an ation＿⟯ where ⟮＿the subset＿ has size k⟯.
»⟮A ation of n⟯« is ⟮＿an ation＿⟯ of a set S where ⟮S has size n⟯.
»⟮A combination/permutation⟯« of a set S is ⟮＿an ation＿⟯ that is ⟮＿unordered/ordered＿⟯.
»⟮A permutation⎵strong⎵⟯« is ⟮＿a k-permutation＿⟯ where ⟮k=n⟯.

### notation

»⟮Letterbased ation notation⟯« (my term) is where ⟮＿the ation＿⟯ is symbolized by ⟮an uppercase letter (C or P)⟯, and ⟮n, k⟯ are either ⟮enclosed as in a function⟯, or ⟮sub/superscripted in some way⟯.

### calculations

If k&gt;n, P or C(n, k) = 0.
⟮P⟯(⟮n, n⟯)=⟮n!⟯
⟮C⟯(⟮n, n⟯)=⟮1 (obv)⟯
⟮P⟯(⟮n, k⟯)=⟮n!/⟯⟮((n-k)!)⟯
⟮C⟯(⟮n, k⟯)=⟮n!/⟯⟮((n-k)!k!)⟯
