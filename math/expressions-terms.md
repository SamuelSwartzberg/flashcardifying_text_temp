## expressions

A closed-form expression is an expression whose parts are all finite.

### algebraic

An algebraic expression is a closed-form expression that allows only integer constants/coefficents, variables, and the arithmetic operations.
An algebraic fraction is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are algebraic expressions.

#### arithmetic

An arithmetic expression is a algebraic expression that allows only integer constants/coefficients and the elementary arithmetic operations.

### polynomial

#### basics

A polynomial expression is expression that allows only constants/coefficients, addition, subtraction and multiplication, indeterminates and non-negative interger exponents.
A polynomial is an abstract expression that can be instantiated by a polynomial expression.
Two polynomials define the same polynomial if they can be transformed into each other by use of the comeassdir properties.
Polynomial evaluation is substitution of a numeric value for each indeterminate.

#### notation

An arbitrary polynomial =sym=&gt; P
A polynomial function =sym=&gt; P(x)

#### form &amp; terms

The standard form of a polynomial is ∑⎵k=0⎵⎴n⎴a⎵k⎵x⎴k⎴.
The factor form of a polynomial is a polynomial represented as factors.
A polynomial term (rare term) is a term of a polynomial.
Polynomial terms are typically ordered by degree.

#### degree

##### degrees

The degree⎵indeterminate⎵ is the exponent value of an indeterminate.
The degree⎵polynomial term⎵ is the sum of the degres of the indeterminates in the polynomial term.
The degree⎵polynomial⎵ is the highest degree of a polynomial term in a polynomial.

##### increasing degrees

The zero polynomial is the polynomial `0`.
The zero polynomial has a degree of undefined, -1 or -∞.
A non-zero polynomial is a polynomial that is not a zero polynomial.
A constant polynomial is a polynomial with degree 0 ≙ no indeterminates.
A linear/quadratic/cubic polynomial/polynomial term is a polynomial/polynomial term with degree 1/2/3.

##### homogeneous

A homogeneous polynomial of degree n is a polynomial where all polynomial terms have degree n.

#### indeterminates

A uni/bi/multivariate polynomial is a polynomial with 1/2/2+ indeterminates.

#### derived things

##### rational fraction

A rational fraction is an algebraic fraction whose numerator and denominator are both polynomials.
A rational expression is an expression that may be rewritten to a rational fraction by using properties of the arithmetic operations.
A rational equation is an equation where the two expressional wffs are rational fractions.

##### algebraic number

An algebraic number is a zero of a non-zero univariate integer polynomial.
All rational numbers and roots of integers are algebraic numbers.
A transcendental number is a number that is not an algebraic number.
e.g. e, π

###### euler's number

Euler's number =symb=&gt; e
e ≈ 2.718
e = ∑⎵n=0⎵⎴∞⎴1/(n!)

##### misc

A polynomial function is a function defined by a polynomial.
A complex/real/integer polynomial is a polynomial with complex/real/integer coefficients.

#### binomial

##### binomial coeficient

The binomial coefficients are the positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem.
A binomial coefficient is the amount of k-combinations of n
^i.e. the amount of subsets of size k of a set with size n.

###### notation

The binomial coefficient can be written using combination notation, or ettingshausen's notation.
Ettingshausen's notation is n placed vertically over k in large parentheses.

##### binomial theorem

(a+b)⎴n⎴ = ∑⎵k=0⎵⎴n⎴C(n,k)a⎴k⎴b⎴n-k⎴

###### n=2

(a+b)⎴2⎴ = a⎴2⎴+2ab+b⎴2⎴
(a-b)⎴2⎴ = a⎴2⎴-2ab+b⎴2⎴
(a+b)(a-b) = a⎴2⎴-b⎴2⎴

##### pascals triangle

Pascal's triangle is a triangle of the values of the binomial coefficient.
Pascal's triangle is read as rows and columns starting at 0.
In pascals's triangle, C(n, k) is the element at row n and column k.
