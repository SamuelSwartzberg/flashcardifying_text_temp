# theoretical philosophy

Theoretical and practical philosophy are often contrasted.
Theoretical philosophy consists of (non-exhaustive) epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and philosophy of science/language/mind.

## epistemology

Epistemology is the branch of theoretical philosophy concerned with knowledge.
in general: 
epistemological   (adj) related to epistemology (as a field of study)
epistemic   (adj) related to knowledge
however, in some cases the meanings of epistemic and epistemological are mixed up.

### evidence

#### ravens

the ⟮c+;raven paradox⟯ is a paradox by ⟮c+;Hempel⟯ which arises from the question of ⟮c+;what constitutes evidence for a statement⟯
The issue at the heart of the ⟮c+;raven paradox⟯ is that objects that are ⟮c+;neither black nor ravens⟯ ⟮c+;increase the likelyhood⟯ that ⟮c+;all ravens are black⟯, even though the intuition is that ⟮c+;these observations are unrelated⟯.
Ravens paradox:
⟮c+;All ravens are black⟯ ( = ⟮c+;If something is a raven, then it is black⟯).
(via ⟮c+;contraposition⟯) ⟮c+;If something is not black, then it is not a raven⟯.
⟮c+;"My pet raven is black" should count as evidence for "If something is a raven, then it is black"⟯
⟮c+;"This green apple is not black, and it is not a raven." should count as evidence for "If something is not black, then it is not a raven."⟯
Since ⟮c+;"If something is a raven, then it is black" is equivalent to "If something is not black, then it is not a raven."⟯, ⟮c+;"This green apple is not black, and it is not a raven." counts as evicence for "My pet raven is black"⟯.
But ⟮c+;that's weird (maybe, it might also seem intuitive)⟯!

#### determination

Underdetermination is if a specific set of evidence eliminates some possible conclusions, but does not guarantee any single conclusion.
Something is underdetermined if there are too few constraints to specify a unique solution.
Overdetermination is if there are multple sets of evidence, explanations, etc., any single one would be enough to account for/determine the conclusion.
If 太郎 and 花子 throw stones at a window, each of which would have been enough to shatter the window, the shattering of the window is overdetermined.

### knowledge

the ⟮c+;KK⟯ ⟮c+;thesis⟯/⟮c+;principle⟯ is the principle "⟮c+;If you know that P⟯ ⟮c+;then you know that you know that P⟯"
Relatively uncontroversially, (propositional/declarative) knowledge is seen to be at least true belief

#### JTB

JTB = Justified True Belief
JTB was claimed to be the classical theory of knowledge, but it probably isn't actually.
Belief in JTB is specifically the doxastic attitude of belief

1. p is true (T)
2. S beliefs that p (B)
3. 

##### epistemic luck

Epistemic luck is having a true belief merely fortuitously.
Generally, epistemic luck is said to be incompatible with knowledge.
The justification part of JTB was added to prevent cases of epistemic luck counting as knowledge.
The coin toss experiment is frequently used as an example of epistemic luck.
The coin toss experiment: We arbitrarily believe that the next coin toss will land heads, and the coin does actually lands heads. We now have a true belief, but only fortuitously.

##### J

⟮c+;the regress argument (although this is also a type of argument)⟯ = ⟮c+;dialllelus/diallelon⟯ = ⟮c+;the (epistemic) regress problem⟯
The diallelus is one of the horns of the agrippa-trilemma, namely the idea that any proposition (premise, etc.) requires further justification and thus ends in an infinite regress.

###### infinitism

Infinitism is the idea that the diallelus horn is acceptable.

###### foundationalism

Foundationalism is one of the horns of the agrippa-trilemma, states that ⟮c+;knowledge⟯ ultimately ⟮c+;rests on certain basic beliefs⟯, which require no further justification.
⟮c+;Foundationalist⟯ theories mainly differ in ⟮c+;what sort of basic beliefs are posited⟯
Things that are often posited as basic beliefs for foundationalism are: self-evident/incorrigible beliefs, beliefs from introspection, beliefs aquired via the senses, or an otherwise special kind of belief (such as decartes "clear and distinct" ideas)
the problem with accepting ⟮c+;truthes of the senses⟯ as ⟮c+;basic beliefs⟯ is that ⟮c+;one might be mislead (e.g. descartes' demon)⟯

####### sense experience

######## myth of the given

The myth of the given was coined by Sellars.
The myth of the given claims the idea that there are such sense experiences that by their mere occurrence give us knowledge of the sense experiences is a myth since things like concepts and language are necessary filters for sense experiences.
The myth of the given is interested in the gap between having the sense-experience of seeing a red triangle and the knowledge of seeing a red triangle
According to the myth of the given, seeing a red triangle alone does not give us the knowledge that I'm having the sensation of seeing a red triangle, since the concepts (red and triangle) and language are also necessary for that knowledge

###### int/ext 

Epistemological ⟮c+;internalism⟯/⟮c+;externalism⟯ is the claim that  ⟮c+;justification⟯ for knowledge depends on ⟮c+;factors that are⟯ ⟮c+;internal⟯/⟮c+;external⟯ to ⟮c+;a person⟯

##### not J/new J

Both the causal theory and reliabilism (and others besides) may be interpreted as giving an updated account of justification or replacing justification with a different criterion entirely.


table:theory|criterion
Casual Theory|S’s belief that p is caused by the fact that p.
Reliabilism|S’s belief that p was produced by a reliable cognitive process
Coherence|S’s belief that p is a member of a coherent set


##### T

Correspondence theory of truth: Truth consists in a relation to reality.
Coherence theory of truth: Truth consists in the coherence of a set of propositions.
Besides coherence theories of truth, there also exist coherence theories of justifcation.

##### B (doxastic attitudes)

doxastic attitudes are attitudes about belief
The ⟮c+;doxastic attitude⟯ of ⟮c+;belief⟯ is ⟮c+;holding a proposition to be true⟯
The ⟮c+;doxastic attitude⟯ of ⟮c+;disbelief⟯ is ⟮c+;holding a proposition to be false⟯

##### gettier

In 1963, Edmund Gettier published "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", where he argued that JTB was not sufficient for knowledge.
It is doubtful that JTB was in fact the dominant account of knowledge before Gettier.

#### imp proc

The kinds of knowledge that are often distinguished are imperative/procedural knowledge, descriptive/declarative/propositional knowledge, and aquaintance knowledge
imperative knowledge = procedural knowledge
Synonyms: ⟮c+;descriptive⟯ knowlege, ⟮c+;declarative⟯ knowledge, ⟮c+;propositional⟯ knowledge.
Descriptive/Declarativ/propositional knowledge|"knowing-that"|The capital of Uzbekistan is Tashkent
Procedural/imperative knowledge|"knowing-how"|Adding numbers

Imperative and declarative programming are terms roughly correlated without imperative/declarative knowledge.
often, when we talk about knowledge in philosophy, what we really mean is descriptive/declarative/propositional knowledge, e.g. most theories of knowledge are really about propositional knowledge
Aquaintance knowledge is a kind of familiarity with the object.

### philosophy of science

⟮c+;Verificationism⟯ ≈ ⟮c+;Verification Principle⟯ ≈ ⟮c+;Verfiability criterion of meaning⟯
⟮c+;Logical empiricism⟯ = ⟮c+;Logical positivism⟯
Logical positivism/empiricism was a movement popular in the early-mid 20th century made up in part by the berlin circle and vienna circle
The main position of logical positivism/empiricism is the verfication priciple.

#### standpoint theory

Standpoint theory = standpoint epistemology.
⟮c+;Standpoint theory (or epistemology)⟯ was founded by ⟮c+;Sandra Harding⟯
Standpoint theory/epistemology makes two claims, the situated knowledge thesis and the inversion thesis
The inversion thesis = people inhabiting a standpoint (which is, remember, membership in a group with shared poltical consciousness) have privileged (less distorted) epistemological access to certain knowledge
the situated knowledge thesis = knowledge is socially situated
Standpoint theory (or epistemology) is often accused of suffering from the bias paradox
The bias paradox is the tension between the situated knowledge thesis and the inversion thesis. That is, if all knowledge is socially situated, how can we say that certain groups have clearer access to certain knowledge?

### arguments

#### reasoning / good arguments

##### abduction

If abduction was deductive, it would be equivalent to the fehlschluss affirming the consequent
```lang=text;
(1) a -&gt; b
(2) b
(3) Therefore: a
```

##### induction

###### new problem of induction

Grue and bleen were coined by goodman to exemplify the "new problem of induction"
Something grue will be green if observed before a fixed time t and blue afterwards
SOmething bleen will be blue if observed before a fixed time t and green afterwards
The "⟮c+;new problem of induction⟯" may be explained like so: Imagine a statement like "⟮c+;All emeralds are green⟯" and a statement "⟮c+;All emeralds are grue.⟯" ⟮c+;Before time t⟯, ⟮c+;both statements⟯ is/are ⟮c+;correct⟯, but ⟮c+;after time t⟯, ⟮c+;only the first⟯ is/are ⟮c+;correct⟯, that is, ⟮c+;only the first statement⟯ is/are ⟮c+;projectable into the future⟯. However, ⟮c+;before time t, we have no way to know this⟯. Therefore, ⟮c+;we have no basis to know which claims are projectable into the future.⟯


##### by analogy

Argument by analogy may or may not be a subtype of inductive arguments.
In an analogy argument two objects A, B share a set of properties S_{p}.
In an analogy argument, A has a property q which we don't know if B has or not.
An analogy argument is one where we argue that since A, B share S_{p}, B must also have q.

#### not about the matter

Arguments from authority cite cite an authority qua authority to support their claim.
Arguments from authority may or may not be fallacious.
An argument from ignorance (aka argumentum ad ignorantiam) claims that because it has not yet been proven false/true, a proposition is true/false

### perspective

#### emic etic

the perspective of an outsider|etic|A 'bavarian' talking about 'Bavaria'
the perspective of a participant of a thing (e.g. culture)|emic|A 'bavarian' talking about 'Bavaria'

#### situatedness

⟮c+;Situatedness⟯ is the general idea that ⟮c+;our location in the social world⟯ ⟮c+;determines⟯ ⟮c+;things about us⟯, in particular our ⟮c+;understanding⟯ and ⟮c+;behaviors⟯. Connected to ⟮c+;standpoint theory⟯, but less rigorously defined. 

### distinctions

#### a priori/a posteriori

flex-container:<img src="sm_paste-53ea783dfd04a9bffc148ed85d5085388c509f07.jpg"><br/>⟮c+;Erkenntnis / Urteile⟯ kann ⟮c+;a priori / a posteriori⟯ sein. 
⟮c+;Urteil a posteriori⟯|⟮c+;Ein Urteil auf Basis von Erfahrung⟯
⟮c+;Urteil a priori⟯|⟮c+;Ein Urteil ohne die Basis der Erfahrung⟯

### scepticism

scepticism is generally doubt towards one or more putative instances of knowledge
scepticism may be global or local
local scepticism = doubt about some thesis or area of knowledge
global scepticism = one cannot know anything to be true or false

### ignorance

Model from Armour:

Things you don't know you don't know   second-order ignorance
Things you know you don't know   First-order ignorance
Things you know   Zero-order ignorance

### definitions

Definitions may be real, nominal, or neither.

#### real

A real definition aims to give some account of the nature of the definiendum.
A real definition may either be intensional or extensional.

##### intensional

An intensional definition's definiens specifies the necessary and sufficient condition for a definiendum X.
Ergo, an intensional definition's definiens includes every item that falls under the definiendum and excludes every item that doesn't fall under the definiendum.
an intensional definition of the seven deadly sins: The sins that were singled out by pope gregory I as particularyly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation.

##### extensional

An extensional definition specifies a definiendum X by listing all elements that fall under the X.
an extensional definition of the seven deadly sins: wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, gluttony are the seven deadly sins
A precising definition of a definiendum X narrows the scope of X.

#### nominal

A nominal definition aims to give some account of the use of the word that represents the definiendum.

##### lexical and dictionary

Lexical and dictionary definition are synonyms when they both refer to a definition of a definiendum X that most closely matches common usage by using other words.
A dictionary definition may specifically be a type of lexical definition that is actually found in a dictionary.

#### neither real nor nominal

##### stipulative

##### precising

##### ameliorative

The idea of an ameliorative definition comes from Haslanger.
A ameliorative definition is a definition of F that one should aim to get people to use, given a particular set of (normative) goals.

### discourse

#### burden of proof

The burden of proof is the requirement to provide sufficent proof for ones position.

### claims

A strong claim is one that is specific/arguable/not-easy-to-wiggle-out-of and relevant/impactful.
A weak claim is one that is wishy-washy and/or irrelevant/obvious.
Language completely determines thought is a strong claim, while language influences thought to some extent is a weak claim.

In both strawman and steelman arguments, a hypothesis P is substituted for another hypothesis Q.
In a steelman argument the new hypothesis Q is more defensible.
Steelman arguments are often performed to not argue against less defensible, easily modifiable claims.
In a strawman argument the new hypothesis Q is less defensible.
In a strawman argument, the pretense is that the new hypothesis Q is one someone would hold, or that it's the original one.

### injustice

#### hermeneutical injustice

⟮c+;Hermeneutical injustice⟯ occurs when ⟮c+;someone's experiences⟯ are n⟮c+;ot well understood⟯ — by ⟮c+;themselves⟯ or by ⟮c+;others⟯ — because these ⟮c+;experiences⟯ do not ⟮c+;fit any concepts known to them (or known to others)⟯.
Hermeneutical injustice often occurs to the historic exclusion of some groups of people from activities, such as scholarship and journalism, that shape the language people use to make sense of their experiences.
A woman that was suffering from sexual harassment before the term was coined or without knowing about the term would have been suffering from hermeneutical injustice
Willful hermeneutical ignorance was coined by pohlhaus.
Willful hermeneutical ignorace is causing hermeneutical injustice by continuing to engage in the world while refusing to learn epistemic resources that would alleviate hermeneutical injustice.
Examples of willful hermeneutical ignorance might be the refusal to use/consider concepts such as white privilege, date rape or hetero-normativity

## metaphysics

The philosophical area of metaphysics is named after aristotles work metaphysics.

### ontology

Ontology is the branch of metaphysics concerned with existence/being/becoming broadly.

#### qualities

##### essentialism

In ontology, essentialism is the view that objects have essential properties.

##### primary/secondary

John locke made a distinction between primary and secondary qualities.
Primary qualities are properties that cause ideas in our mind that resemble the qualities in the objects
Secondary qualities are properties that cause ideas in our mind that do not resemble the qualities in the objects
prototypical primary qualities: Size, number, etc.
prototypical secondary qualities: color, smell, etc.

#### mereology

Mereology is the study of parts and wholes.
A gestalt is a thing that is ⟮c+;more than the sum of its parts⟯

#### universals

Universals are the kind of entities that can  be instatiated by many different things, if one thinks they exist.
The problem of whether universals have an independent existance   The problem of universals

(universal) realism|universals exist
nominalism|universals are merely names for sets
conceptualism|universals merely exist in the mind (but are more than mere sets)

#### amount

all forms of monism claim that for whatever they are about, there is only one of that thing
all forms of dualism claim that for whatever they are about, there are two fundamental kinds of things

#### time

Presentism is the ontological attitude that only the present (neither the past nor the future) exists.

#### reality

##### realism

⟮c+;(Metaphysical) realism⟯ is the view that objects exist independently of our thoughts.
While subjective idealism is metaphysically anti-realist, objective realis is metaphysically idealist.

#### social ontology

Ásta, in her book 『Categories we live by』 investigates social properties/categories.
For Ásta, a social property/status consists of certain constraints and enablements in a certain context.
To Ásta, one recieves a social property by others.
Ásta, in her book 『Categories we live by』 suggests three possible ways we might say a social property comes to be, a response-dependent account, a constitutive accound and a conferallist account.
Ásta means her conferralist framework to apply to any social property, but cares most about categories at issue currently:sex, gender, LGBTQ, race, religion etc. 
Asta distinguishes two kinds of social properties: institutional properties and communal properties.

##### response-dependence

response-dependent property formula: ⟮c+;P is Q⟯ ⟮c+;iff⟯ it ⟮c+;induces response R⟯ in ⟮c+;being B⟯ in ⟮c+;context C⟯
Response-dependent account of the property being-red: A thing is red iff it reduces the experience of looking red in a suitable subject in a suitable context.
Response-dependent accounts of social properties face the criticism that they can't account for someone being mistaken in applying a property, which is particularly problematic in cases such as misgendering. A response by some has been to chagne "induces response" to "merits response", though it is unclear if this solves anything.

##### constitutivity

What Ásta calls a constitutive account of social properties is ⟮c+;searles (early) account of a constitutive rule⟯
Constitutive account of a property: X counts as Y in context C.
Constitutive account of being-a-paperweight: a stone smaller than 10cm in diameter counts as a paperweight in the context of my des
The constitutive account makes finding out if something has a property a merely epistemic task (was Y X, and was there context C), and X is still Y even if no one ever tries to detect the property.

###### constitutive and regulative rules

A constitutive rule creates or defines new forms of behavior.
A regulative rule regulates existing forms of behavior.

##### conferralism

In Ásta's own conferralist account, in trying to track a property P1 of an individual, another social property P2 gets applied to that individual.
The property P1 that is being tracked is known as the base property, the property that is being applied is known as the conferred property, the process of applying P2 is known as a conferral.
In Ásta's conferralist account the base property P1 being tracked may not actually be there, nevertheless, the conferred property P2 will still be applied.
In Ásta's conferralist account, a property is socially signficant if it is used as a base property for a conferral of a conferred property.
To Ásta, conferral creates the social property, which would not have existed otherwise.
In Ásta's conferralist account, if in trying to track the base property of the physical trajectory of the ball of a pitch, the umpire confers the conferred property of a pitch being a strike, then the pitch has the social property: "is a strike".

###### applications

To Ásta, the increasing switch to saying self-identification is what is relevant to gender is a switch to self-identification as the base property being tracked.
Ásta says that her account of social properties is faithful to Butler's idea that sex is just as constructed as gender is, since sex is just another conferred property based on certain base properties, either of which could be different.
To Ásta, a certain conferred property can be conferred via radically different base properties, based on the situation.
To Ásta, gender is a property where people are tracking widely different base properties to confer the conferred property, but have the (often false) idea that tracking one thing tracks the other things automatically.
Things that people may be tracking to confer gender: role in societal organization, in presentation of the body, in prepation of food, in biological reproduction, as sexual partner
Since gender is tracked via a variety of different base properties, people may not always get conferred the same gender. E.g. if sexual availability is being tracked by men, a lesbian woman may not get conferred the social property of woman.
If one is not eligible to marry, but the person marries one anyway without noticing (thus failing to track the base property), the conferralist account says one will be ⟮c+;married anyway (since conferral only relies on the perception of the property)⟯ - mirroring reality, where one would also be treated as married.

###### power to confer

To Ásta, for a conferral to succeed, the conferrer must generally themselves have a kind of social property, either one that conveys authority or standing (these are parts of the enablements of the social property).
Since auuthority or standing are enablements that are part of certain social properties, they themselves must first be conferred.
To Ásta, for a conferral to succeed, besides the conferrer having a social property conveying authority or standing themselves, they may only have this qua other people, "citing" it.
To Ásta, communal properties require standing to confer, while institutional properties require authority to confer.
To Ásta, examples of communal properties might be popular, bully, gender, while examples of institutional properties might be married, student, citizen.
To Ásta, conferrals are generally not decided ad-hoc, instead people carry around ready-made patterns for conferral called social maps.
An example for a social map might be a pattern for how we confer gender (A "gender map").
In case a conferral/which social map to apply is contested, either a side will win out, or different properties will be conferred in different micro-contexts.

###### natural properties

While social properties are aquired by virtue of something about other people (e.g. conferralism, response-dependence, etc.), natural properties are not.
Ásta argues that if a property P is used to explain many social facts and seemingly many natural facts, but on closer inspection we can find (a) nearby property(s) that explain(s) the natural facts, then that property P is a social property. Thus, as sex as encoded on one's birth certificate explains many social facts, but the natural facts (ability to bear children, propensity for illnesses, ..) are in fact explained by chromosomes, hormones, other physical features, sex is a social property.

###### virtues

Ásta offers two virtues of her conferralist account: The conferral aspect, and the perception aspect.
conferral aspect|conferralism offers a story of the aquisition of a property (not just an outcome
perception aspect|conferralism cares about the perception of the base property and not its actual presence

##### mega social roles

A mega social role (coined by Charlotte WItt) is a social role which unifies other social roles and serves as their foundation (inflects them).
Charlotte Witt argues that the only mega social role is gender (-.-)

## philosophy of mind

Philosophy of Mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical body.


### dualism

mind-body dualism claims that mind and body are radically different types of things

### monism

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png

In the philosphy of mind, physicalism/materialism, idealism and neutral monism all are monistic theories
idealism claims that only mind and mental contents exist and that matter is reducible to it.
⟮c+;subjective idealism⟯ is the idea that only minds/mental contents of individual percievers exist.
George berkeley was the main proponent of subjective idealism.
objective idealism is the idea that only one mind exists, which does all the percieving.
⟮c+;Neutral monism⟯ claims that ultimate reality is neither mental nor physical and both mental and physical states are derived from a neutral entity.
neutral monism occupies a middle position between ⟮c+;idealism (only minds and mental contents exist) and Physicalism (only matter exists)⟯
⟮c+;materialism/physicalism⟯ holds that only matter exists and that mental states are reducible to it.

#### transcendental idealism

The noumenon/phenomenon distinction goes back to kant.
Something whose existance is in some way dependent human senses/perceptions   Phenomenon
Something that exists ⁑independent⁑ of human senses/perceptions   Noumenon

## philosophy of language

The linguistic turn is said to have brought philosophy of language as well as logic to the forefront of philosophy

### meaning

A theory of meaning either asks 'which entities have which kind of meanings' or 'how do certain entities end up having meanings at all'

#### which entities have which meanings

##### reference

direct reference theory ≈ referential theory ≈ referentially realist theory.
DR theories say the meaning of X lies in the Y it refers to.
DR theories exist on a scale of what X they claim has meaning in virtue of the Y it refers to: Every linguistic item, only nouns, and only names.
under DR(every linguistic item) and DR(Noun), the meaning of dog and 犬 are the idea of a dog or the set of all dogs or something of the like.
under DR(every linguistic item) and DR(Noun) and DR(Name), the meaning of 「Greta Thunberg」is the person Greta Thunberg.
DR(every linguistic item) runs into problems where the reference of functional categories is unclear.
DR(every linguistic item), DR(noun), and DR(Name) all run into problems with the lack of good canditates for the referents of nonexistent things.
Any DR theory may run into problems with the reference of things that gain their meaning only in larger phrases (even if nouns), e.g. a cahoot.
Most DR theories run into the problem that simple lists of references don't mean anything.
Most DR theories run into the problem that even lists of words that link correct word classes together (e.g. SVO in english) do not mean anything without proper grammar. 

##### use theory

###### wittgenstein's language games

#### by virtue of what do things have meanings

##### reference

In looking at reference, Kripke distinguishes speaker-reference, which is the thing the speaker means to refer to, while the semantic reference is the thing it 'actually' refers to, fixed by linguistic facts etc.

### direction of fit

⟮c+;direction of fit⟯ is how words/speech acts/language and the world conform to each other.
there are two sets of distinctions in direction of fit: mind-to-world/world-to-mind and word-to-world/world-to-word
A mental state where the contents of the mental state are trying to model reality has mind-to-world direction of fit.
Mind-to-world mental states: beliefs
A mental state where the mental state is trying to change the world to fit their content has world-to-mind direction of fit.
World-to-mind mental states: desires
An utterance/text/whatever where the thing is trying to model the world has word-to-world direction of fit
An utterance/text/whatever where the world is changed as a reaction to the text it has world-to-word direction of fit
We write down the things already in our shopping cart onto a piece of paper   word-to-world direction of fit
We put things in a shopping cart based on what's on our shopping list   world-to-word direction of fit

### loaded question

A ⟮c+;loaded question⟯ is a question that ⟮c+;contains a controversial assumption (presupposition⟯) (e.g. ⟮c+;s2;have you stopped beating your wife⟯)

## philosophy of science

Philosophy of science has existed in some form for a long time, but really gained steam from the beginning of the 20th century

### paradigms

The idea of paradigms, incommensurability comes from Tomas Kuhn's 1962 『The Structure of Scientific Revolutions』
For Kuhn, two things are incommensurable if it is impossible to completely understand and translate one thing into the terms of another.
Two paradigms are incommensurable.
Examples for paradigms might be the germ theory of disease and Galen's miasma theory.
In a general non-philosophical, non-mathemtatical sense, incommensurable means having no common measure.

#### process

Science happens in periods of normal science and scientific revolutions. (Kuhn)
Normal science is the period where research happens under a prevailing paradigm.
A scientific revolution is the period where a paradigm shift happens.
The most famous scientific revolution is the transition between the worldview of Newtonian gravity and general relativity.
During normal science, anomalies accumulate.
Eventually, enough anomalies accumulate and science is thrown into crisis, forcing scientists to engage in extraordinary (= exploratory) research.
During extraordinary research, new things are tried and fundamentals are debated.
A paradigm shift is when a new paradigm is adopted.
After extraordinary research, eventually a paradigm shift happens.
After a new paradigm is adopted, it is institutionalized and thus the revolutionary process of how it was adopted is defanged/obscured. (Kuhn)

## logic

### terms

Terms may either be singular or general.
Singular terms consist of definite and indefinite descriptions, indexicals or proper names.

#### singular

##### definite descriptions

definite descriptions refer to an entity with the claim that there is exactly one such entity, but not by using its name
In english, definite descriptions use 'the'.
If a definite description's claim that there is exactly one such entity holds true, it is proper.
If a definite description's claim that there is exactly one such entity  does not hold true, it is improper.

###### attr and ref

Donnelan distinguishes two usages of a definite description (generally within the context "The F is G"): attributive, where the speaker says something like "Whatever is F is G", and referential, which expresses something like "This thing, which I believe to be F, is G" (not formally logically correct formulation)
(the default position is that) The attributive use of definite descriptions "Whatever is F is G" doesn't express anything if there is no F
(the default position is that) The referential use of definite descriptions "This thing, which I believe to be F, is G" still says that the entity is G even if there is no F
Donnellan would say that "The current King of France is bald" would have no truth value if there is no current king of france , it being a attributive use of a definite descriptor
Donnellan would say that "Her husband is kind to her" would hold true/ have a truth value even if the person referred to is not her husband but her boyfriend, it being a referential use of a definite descriptor

##### indefinite description

indefinite descriptions refer to an entity without a claim that there is merely one such entity.
In english, indefinite descriptions use 'a(n)'.

### modality

Modality is about the way things could (not) or must have been. It is contrasted with the actual state of affairs.

#### necessity and contingency

necessarily true   If it can't be false
necessarily false   If it can't be true
A proposition is contingent if it is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.

#### counterfactuals

Counterfactual conditionals are conditional sentences which discuss what would have been true under different circumstances.

#### possible worlds

One of the main ways to bear out modal logic is in terms of possible worlds.
Possible worlds are most associated with Kripke.
In modal logic using possible worlds, a sentence may have different truth values in different possible worlds.

##### rigid and flaccid

flaccid designator ≈ non-rigid designator ≈ connotative term
A flaccid designator is a term that may pick out things in other possible worlds.
A rigid designator is a term that picks out the same thing in all possible worlds in which it exists.
Lycan paraphrases Kripke offering a test for if a term is rigid: if the sentence "N might not have been N" is true it is flaccid, else it is rigid

## Kant

Bei ⟮c+;Kant⟯ gibt es zwei Arten von Vernunfterkenntnis, ⟮c+;materiale Vernunfterkenntnis⟯, die sich ⟮c+;auf ein irgendwie geartetes Objekt⟯ bezieht, und ⟮c+;formale Vernunfterkenntnis⟯, die sich ⟮c+;auf kein objekt, sondern auf die Form des Verstandes selber bezieht⟯.

# practical philosophy

Practical philosophy consists of (non-exhaustive) Ethics, Aesthetics, and Political Philosophy
deontic   (adj) related to necessity/duty/obligation/morality = "should"
In a wide sense, deontology is synonymous with ethics, and in a narrow sense it is an ethical position.

## ethics

### metaethics

meta-ethics is the study of the nature, scope, and meaning of moral judgment.

#### essentialism

Moral essentialism claims that there are things that are wrong in an absolute/essential sense.

### normative ethics

Normative ethics is the study of how one ought to act.

#### ethical hedonism

Ethical hedonism claims that increasing pleasure and decreasing pain determines goodness/value.

##### experience machine

Nozick's 『Anarchy, State, and Utopia』 (1974) contains the famous experience machine thought experiment.
Nozick's 『Anarchy, State, and Utopia』 is said to be responding to Rawls' ⟮c+;A Theory of Justice⟯ (1971)
The Experience machine is a thought experiment against ethical hedonism.
For the experience machine thought experiment, one is offered to enter a machnine, which, while floating within it, would give us pleasurable experiences. We would not know we were in the machine (it would seem like real life to us), and the machine could not fail. 
Nozick argues one would not want to enter the experience machine, for example because it would limit us to a man-made reality, we want to be a certain sort of person, etc.

## demands

the original ⟮c+;catch-22⟯ (since ⟮c+;it's used in many different ways later in the book⟯): ⟮c+;If you're declared insane, you get sent home from fighting⟯:
-&gt; ⟮c+;s13:14;If you say you're insane (or apply for insanity⟯), that ⟮c+;s13:14;makes you sane, and so you still have to fight.⟯
-&gt; And ⟮c+;s11:12;if you don't say you're insane (or apply for insanity⟯) ⟮c+;s11:12;you still have to fight⟯. 
The ⟮c+;original⟯ ⟮c+;catch-22⟯ ⟮c+;from the book⟯ is ⟮c+;just a constructive dilemma⟯. 
The term ⟮c+;catch-22⟯ is also often used as ⟮c+;a synonym for deadlock (in the CS sense⟯). 
The term ⟮c+;catch-22⟯ may at its most broad just refer to ⟮c+;a kind of contradiction or problem involving 2 things.⟯ 
A double bind is a demand or set of demands which is/are not all fulfillable at the same time, thus automatically incurring whatever sanctions are attached to the demand.

## motiviation

### higher-order volition

A second-order desire/volition is a desire to have something as one's desire.
E.g. if one wishes one wanted to eat less so one was thinner, the wish to be thinner and the (hypothetical) wish to eat leass are first-order desires, but the desire to desire to eat less is a second-order desire.

# continental philosopy

analytic philosophy is said to dominate in the west and especially in the anglosphere
analytical philosophy mainly contrasts with continental philosophy

## critical theory

Critical Theory (capital letters) was established by the Frankfurt School.
The Frankfurt School was established in the 1920.
Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse etc. are the most prominent members of The Frankfurt School

## structuralism & poststructuralism

Postmodernism had its heyday in the 1970s and has been declining since the 90s/2000s

# history of philosophy

## feminism

### contemporary

⟮c+;Hypatia⟯ is perhaps the ⟮c+;most famous/important⟯ journal about ⟮c+;feminist philosophy⟯

#### the tuvel affair

In ⟮c+;2017⟯, the journal ⟮c+;hypatia⟯ published an article by ⟮c+;rebecca tuvel⟯ in favor of ⟮c+;transracialism⟯ (which led to a large controversy). ⟮s1:4;After it was released, an ⟮c+;open letter⟯ was ⟮c+;written⟯ requesting ⟮c+;the article be retracted⟯, signed by ⟮c+;800⟯ scholars. ⟮s5:7;The criticisms  related to tuvel herself were  ⟮c+;an alleged immersion in white and cisgender privilege⟯, related to the journal ⟮c+;an alleged mishandling of the review process⟯. ⟮s8:9;The ⟮c+;wider academic community⟯ reacted to ⟮c+;the open letter⟯ with ⟮c+;an outporing of support for Tuvel⟯. After the affair, the journal ⟮c+;was thrown into crisis⟯.⟯⟯⟯
The tuvel affair was seen by those who wanted to see it as such as a clash between analytic and continental philosophy.

## problem of evil

»The Problem of Evil« is the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil/suffering with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God.
A response that seeks to justify god in relation to the ＿problem of evil＿ is known as a »theodicy«.
An example of a theodicy is Leibniz's claim that the existing world is 「the best of all possible worlds」
Sometimes ＿theodicy＿ is also understood in a wider sense as any justification of a deity or their attributes.
A more limited response to the problem of evil that only seeks to prove that there are possible ways to reconcile the existence of evil with omnipotence/benevolence/niscience is sometimes known as a defense.

## arguments for/against the belief in god

### for

#### pascals wager

Pascal’s Wager is the name given to an argument by Blaise Pascal for believing, or for at least taking steps to believe, in God.
Pascal actually presents three possible wager-like arguments, of which only the final one is acutally called pascals wager.
Pascal's wager argues that it is rational to live as though God exists and (seek to) believe in God.
According to Pascal's Wager, it is rational to (seek to) believe in god because if God does not exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas if God does exist, one will have infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) (and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell)).
The perhaps most commonly cited objection to pascal's wager, besides the fact that it isn't really a proof of god at all, is the argument from inauthentic belief, that god would not be satisified with belief that was mrere calculation.

## theories of humor/laughter

In ⟮c+;the incongruity theory of humor⟯, something is funny because ⟮c+;it somehow violates our expectations⟯ 
In ⟮c+;the relief theory of laughter⟯, ⟮c+;laughter/humor is the release of pent-up nervous energy⟯/ 
The ⟮c+;relief theory of laughter⟯ reliess (explicitly or implicitly) on the metaphor of ⟮c+;a steam valve⟯ 
The problem with ⟮c+;the relief theory of laughter⟯ is that ⟮c+;nervous energy isn't a real thing that one would need to release.⟯ 
⟮c+;The superiority theory (of humor/laughter⟯) is the theory that ⟮c+;laughter expresses feelings of superiority⟯ over ⟮c+;other people⟯ or over ⟮c+;a former state of ourselves⟯ (main supporters (possibly, depending on how you read them): ⟮c+;Plato, Hobbes, Descartes⟯ ) 
<div class="cloze-group hide-if-inactive">
  The problem with the ⟮c+;superoiority theory of humor/laughter:⟯ 
<ol>
<li>since there are cases in ⟮c+;which one feels superior to someone (i.e. a beggar⟯) but ⟮c+;feels pity rather than laughs⟯, ⟮c+;superiority is not sufficient to explain laughter⟯</li>
<li>Since there are cases in which ⟮c+;one laughts but doesn't feel superior⟯, ⟮c+;superiority is not necessary to explain laughter⟯</li>

## Kundera

In "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", Milan Kundera argues there are four audiences that people need (in different degrees) to look at them:
- Many anonymous people
- Many known people
- The person they love
- An imaginary audience
Drawing on Nietsche, in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" Milan Kundera ponders whether life is light or heavy.
To say life is heavy is to say that every decision and existence is incredibly meaningful, because there will never be an opportunity to redo it.
To say life is light is to say that every decision and existence is without meaning, because it will not recur and will therefore be lost to the eternal flow of time.

Utopia and dystopia both describe imaginary societies.
utopia|is great/nearly perfect
dystopia|is terrible, oppressive
