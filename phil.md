# theoretical philosophy

## epistemology

Epistemology is the branch of theoretical philosophy concerned with knowledge.
in general: 
epistemological   (adj) related to epistemology (as a field of study)
epistemic   (adj) related to knowledge
however, in some cases the meanings of epistemic and epistemological are mixed up.

### evidence

#### ravens

the ⟮c1;raven paradox⟯ is a paradox by ⟮c2;Hempel⟯ which arises from the question of ⟮c3;what constitutes evidence for a statement⟯
The issue at the heart of the ⟮c1;raven paradox⟯ is that objects that are ⟮c2;neither black nor ravens⟯ ⟮c3;increase the likelyhood⟯ that ⟮c4;all ravens are black⟯, even though the intuition is that ⟮c5;these observations are unrelated⟯.
Ravens paradox:
⟮c1;All ravens are black⟯ ( = ⟮c1;If something is a raven, then it is black⟯).
(via ⟮c2;contraposition⟯) ⟮c3;If something is not black, then it is not a raven⟯.
⟮c4;"My pet raven is black" should count as evidence for "If something is a raven, then it is black"⟯
⟮c5;"This green apple is not black, and it is not a raven." should count as evidence for "If something is not black, then it is not a raven."⟯
Since ⟮c6;"If something is a raven, then it is black" is equivalent to "If something is not black, then it is not a raven."⟯, ⟮c7;"This green apple is not black, and it is not a raven." counts as evicence for "My pet raven is black"⟯.
But ⟮c8;that's weird (maybe, it might also seem intuitive)⟯!

### knowledge

the ⟮c1;KK⟯ ⟮c1;thesis⟯/⟮c1;principle⟯ is the principle "⟮c2;If you know that P⟯ ⟮c3;then you know that you know that P⟯"
Relatively uncontroversially, (propositional/declarative) knowledge is seen to be at least true belief

#### JTB

JTB = Justified True Belief
Belief in JTB is specifically the doxastic attitude of belief

##### epistemic luck

Epistemic luck is having a true belief merely fortuitously.
Generally, epistemic luck is said to be incompatible with knowledge.
The justification part of JTB was added to prevent cases of epistemic luck counting as knowledge.
The coin toss experiment is frequently used as an example of epistemic luck.
The coin toss experiment: We arbitrarily believe that the next coin toss will land heads, and the coin does actually lands heads. We now have a true belief, but only fortuitously.

##### J

⟮c3;the regress argument (although this is also a type of argument)⟯ = ⟮c4;dialllelus/diallelon⟯ = ⟮c5;the (epistemic) regress problem⟯
The diallelus is one of the horns of the agrippa-trilemma, namely the idea that any proposition (premise, etc.) requires further justification and thus ends in an infinite regress.
Infinitism is the idea that the diallelus horn is acceptable.
Foundationalism is one of the horns of the agrippa-trilemma, states that ⟮c4;knowledge⟯ ultimately ⟮c3;rests on certain basic beliefs⟯, which require no further justification.
⟮c1;Foundationalist⟯ theories mainly differ in ⟮c2;what sort of basic beliefs are posited⟯
Things that are often posited as basic beliefs for foundationalism are: self-evident/incorrigible beliefs, beliefs from introspection, beliefs aquired via the senses, or an otherwise special kind of belief (such as decartes "clear and distinct" ideas)
the problem with accepting ⟮c1;truthes of the senses⟯ as ⟮c2;basic beliefs⟯ is that ⟮c3;one might be mislead (e.g. descartes' demon)⟯

###### int/ext 

Epistemological ⟮c1;internalism⟯/⟮c1;externalism⟯ is the claim that  ⟮c3;justification⟯ for knowledge depends on ⟮c5;factors that are⟯ ⟮c2;internal⟯/⟮c2;external⟯ to ⟮c4;a person⟯

##### T

Correspondence theory of truth: Truth consists in a relation to reality.
Coherence theory of truth: Truth consists in the coherence of a set of propositions

##### B (doxastic attitudes)

doxastic attitudes are attitudes about belief
The ⟮c2;doxastic attitude⟯ of ⟮c1;belief⟯ is ⟮c3;holding a proposition to be true⟯
The ⟮c2;doxastic attitude⟯ of ⟮c1;disbelief⟯ is ⟮c3;holding a proposition to be false⟯

##### gettier

In 1963, Edmund Gettier published "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", where he argued that JTB was not sufficient for knowledge.
It is doubtful that JTB was in fact the dominant account of knowledge before Gettier.

#### imp proc

The kinds of knowledge that are often distinguished are imperative/procedural knowledge, descriptive/declarative/propositional knowledge, and aquaintance knowledge
imperative knowledge = procedural knowledge
Synonyms: ⟮c1;descriptive⟯ knowlege, ⟮c2;declarative⟯ knowledge, ⟮c3;propositional⟯ knowledge.
Descriptive/Declarativ/propositional knowledge|"knowing-that"|The capital of Uzbekistan is Tashkent
Procedural/imperative knowledge|"knowing-how"|Adding numbers

Imperative and declarative programming are terms roughly correlated without imperative/declarative knowledge.
often, when we talk about knowledge in philosophy, what we really mean is descriptive/declarative/propositional knowledge, e.g. most theories of knowledge are really about propositional knowledge
Aquaintance knowledge is a kind of familiarity with the object.

### philosophy of science

⟮c1;Verificationism⟯ ≈ ⟮c2;Verification Principle⟯ ≈ ⟮c3;Verfiability criterion of meaning⟯
⟮c1;Logical empiricism⟯ = ⟮c2;Logical positivism⟯
Logical positivism/empiricism was a movement popular in the early-mid 20th century made up in part by the berlin circle and vienna circle
The main position of logical positivism/empiricism is the verfication priciple.

#### standpoint theory

Standpoint theory = standpoint epistemology.
⟮c1;Standpoint theory (or epistemology)⟯ was founded by ⟮c2;Sandra Harding⟯
Standpoint theory/epistemology makes two claims, the situated knowledge thesis and the inversion thesis
The inversion thesis = people inhabiting a standpoint (which is, remember, membership in a group with shared poltical consciousness) have privileged (less distorted) epistemological access to certain knowledge
the situated knowledge thesis = knowledge is socially situated
Standpoint theory (or epistemology) is often accused of suffering from the bias paradox
The bias paradox is the tension between the situated knowledge thesis and the inversion thesis. That is, if all knowledge is socially situated, how can we say that certain groups have clearer access to certain knowledge?

### reasoning

#### abduction

If abduction was deductive, it would be equivalent to the fehlschluss affirming the consequent
```lang=text;
(1) a -&gt; b
(2) b
(3) Therefore: a
```

#### induction

##### new problem of induction

Grue and bleen were coined by goodman to exemplify the "new problem of induction"
Something grue will be green if observed before a fixed time t and blue afterwards
SOmething bleen will be blue if observed before a fixed time t and green afterwards
The "⟮c2;new problem of induction⟯" may be explained like so: Imagine a statement like "⟮c1;All emeralds are green⟯" and a statement "⟮c1;All emeralds are grue.⟯" ⟮c3;Before time t⟯, ⟮c4;both statements⟯ is/are ⟮c5;correct⟯, but ⟮c3;after time t⟯, ⟮c4;only the first⟯ is/are ⟮c5;correct⟯, that is, ⟮c5;only the first statement⟯ is/are ⟮c6;projectable into the future⟯. However, ⟮c7;before time t, we have no way to know this⟯. Therefore, ⟮c8;we have no basis to know which claims are projectable into the future.⟯

### perspective

#### emic etic

the perspective of an outsider|etic|A 'bavarian' talking about 'Bavaria'
the perspective of a participant of a thing (e.g. culture)|emic|A 'bavarian' talking about 'Bavaria'

### scepticism

scepticism is generally doubt towards one or more putative instances of knowledge
scepticism may be global or local
local scepticism = doubt about some thesis or area of knowledge
global scepticism = one cannot know anything to be true or false

### ignorance

Model from Armour:

Things you don't know you don't know   second-order ignorance
Things you know you don't know   First-order ignorance
Things you know   Zero-order ignorance

### definitions

Types of definition: intensional, extensional, lexical, dictionary, precising.
An intensional definition specifies the necessary and sufficient condition for a definiendum X.
an intensional definition of the seven deadly sins: The sins that were singled out by pope gregory I as particularyly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation.
An extensional definition specifies a definiendum X by listing all elements that fall under the X.
an extensional definition of the seven deadly sins: wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, gluttony are the seven deadly sins
A precising definition of a definiendum X narrows the scope of X.
Lexical and dictionary definition are synonyms when they both refer to a definition of a definiendum X that most closely matches common usage by using other words.
A dictionary definition may specifically be a type of lexical definition that is actually found in a dictionary.

### claims

A strong claim is one that is specific/arguable/not-easy-to-wiggle-out-of and relevant/impactful.
A weak claim is one that is wishy-washy and/or irrelevant/obvious.
Language completely determines thought is a strong claim, while language influences thought to some extent is a weak claim.

In both strawman and steelman arguments, a hypothesis P is substituted for another hypothesis Q.
In a steelman argument the new hypothesis Q is more defensible.
Steelman arguments are often performed to not argue against less defensible, easily modifiable claims.
In a strawman argument the new hypothesis Q is less defensible.
In a strawman argument, the pretense is that the new hypothesis Q is one someone would hold, or that it's the original one.

### injustice

#### hermeneutical injustice

⟮c1;Hermeneutical injustice⟯ occurs when ⟮c2;someone's experiences⟯ are n⟮c3;ot well understood⟯ — by ⟮c4;themselves⟯ or by ⟮c4;others⟯ — because these ⟮c2;experiences⟯ do not ⟮c5;fit any concepts known to them (or known to others)⟯.
Hermeneutical injustice often occurs to the historic exclusion of some groups of people from activities, such as scholarship and journalism, that shape the language people use to make sense of their experiences.
A woman that was suffering from sexual harassment before the term was coined or without knowing about the term would have been suffering from hermeneutical injustice
Willful hermeneutical ignorance was coined by pohlhaus.
Willful hermeneutical ignorace is causing hermeneutical injustice by continuing to engage in the world while refusing to learn epistemic resources that would alleviate hermeneutical injustice.
Examples of willful hermeneutical ignorance might be the refusal to use/consider concepts such as white privilege, date rape or hetero-normativity

## metaphysics

The philosophical area of metaphysics is named after aristotles work metaphysics.

### ontology

Ontology is the branch of metaphysics concerned with existence/being/becoming broadly.

#### qualities

John locke made a distinction between primary and secondary qualities.
Primary qualities are properties that cause ideas in our mind that resemble the qualities in the objects
Secondary qualities are properties that cause ideas in our mind that do not resemble the qualities in the objects
prototypical primary qualities: Size, number, etc.
prototypical secondary qualities: color, smell, etc.

#### mereology

Mereology is the study of parts and wholes.
A gestalt is a thing that is ⟮c1;more than the sum of its parts⟯

#### universals

Universals are the kind of entities that can  be instatiated by many different things, if one thinks they exist.
The problem of whether universals have an independent existance   The problem of universals

(universal) realism|universals exist
nominalism|universals are merely names for sets

#### amount

all forms of monism claim that for whatever they are about, there is only one of that thing
all forms of dualism claim that for whatever they are about, there are two fundamental kinds of things

#### reality

##### realism

⟮c1;(Metaphysical) realism⟯ is the view that objects exist independently of our thoughts.
While subjective idealism is metaphysically anti-realist, objective realis is metaphysically idealist.

#### social ontology

Ásta, in her book 『Categories we live by』 investigates social properties/categories.
For Ásta, a social property/status consists of certain constraints and enablements in a certain context.
To Ásta, one recieves a social property by others.
Ásta, in her book 『Categories we live by』 suggests three possible ways we might say a social property comes to be, a response-dependent account, a constitutive accound and a conferallist account.
Ásta means her conferralist framework to apply to any social property, but cares most about categories at issue currently:sex, gender, LGBTQ, race, religion etc. 
Asta distinguishes two kinds of social properties: institutional properties and communal properties.

##### response-dependence

response-dependent property formula: ⟮c1;P is Q⟯ ⟮c2;iff⟯ it ⟮c3;induces response R⟯ in ⟮c4;being B⟯ in ⟮c5;context C⟯
Response-dependent account of the property being-red: A thing is red iff it reduces the experience of looking red in a suitable subject in a suitable context.
Response-dependent accounts of social properties face the criticism that they can't account for someone being mistaken in applying a property, which is particularly problematic in cases such as misgendering. A response by some has been to chagne "induces response" to "merits response", though it is unclear if this solves anything.

##### constitutivity

What Ásta calls a constitutive account of social properties is ⟮c1;searles (early) account of a constitutive rule⟯
Constitutive account of a property: X counts as Y in context C.
Constitutive account of being-a-paperweight: a stone smaller than 10cm in diameter counts as a paperweight in the context of my des
The constitutive account makes finding out if something has a property a merely epistemic task (was Y X, and was there context C), and X is still Y even if no one ever tries to detect the property.

##### conferralism

In Ásta's own conferralist account, in trying to track a property P1 of an individual, another social property P2 gets applied to that individual.
The property P1 that is being tracked is known as the base property, the property that is being applied is known as the conferred property, the process of applying P2 is known as a conferral.
In Ásta's conferralist account the base property P1 being tracked may not actually be there, nevertheless, the conferred property P2 will still be applied.
In Ásta's conferralist account, a property is socially signficant if it is used as a base property for a conferral of a conferred property.
To Ásta, conferral creates the social property, which would not have existed otherwise.
In Ásta's conferralist account, if in trying to track the base property of the physical trajectory of the ball of a pitch, the umpire confers the conferred property of a pitch being a strike, then the pitch has the social property: "is a strike".

###### applications

To Ásta, the increasing switch to saying self-identification is what is relevant to gender is a switch to self-identification as the base property being tracked.
Ásta says that her account of social properties is faithful to Butler's idea that sex is just as constructed as gender is, since sex is just another conferred property based on certain base properties, either of which could be different.
To Ásta, a certain conferred property can be conferred via radically different base properties, based on the situation.
To Ásta, gender is a property where people are tracking widely different base properties to confer the conferred property, but have the (often false) idea that tracking one thing tracks the other things automatically.
Things that people may be tracking to confer gender: role in societal organization, in presentation of the body, in prepation of food, in biological reproduction, as sexual partner
Since gender is tracked via a variety of different base properties, people may not always get conferred the same gender. E.g. if sexual availability is being tracked by men, a lesbian woman may not get conferred the social property of woman.
If one is not eligible to marry, but the person marries one anyway without noticing (thus failing to track the base property), the conferralist account says one will be ⟮c1;married anyway (since conferral only relies on the perception of the property)⟯ - mirroring reality, where one would also be treated as married.

###### power to confer

To Ásta, for a conferral to succeed, the conferrer must generally themselves have a kind of social property, either one that conveys authority or standing (these are parts of the enablements of the social property).
Since auuthority or standing are enablements that are part of certain social properties, they themselves must first be conferred.
To Ásta, for a conferral to succeed, besides the conferrer having a social property conveying authority or standing themselves, they may only have this qua other people, "citing" it.
To Ásta, communal properties require standing to confer, while institutional properties require authority to confer.
To Ásta, examples of communal properties might be popular, bully, gender, while examples of institutional properties might be married, student, citizen.
To Ásta, conferrals are generally not decided ad-hoc, instead people carry around ready-made patterns for conferral called social maps.
An example for a social map might be a pattern for how we confer gender (A "gender map").
In case a conferral/which social map to apply is contested, either a side will win out, or different properties will be conferred in different micro-contexts.

###### natural properties

While social properties are aquired by virtue of something about other people (e.g. conferralism, response-dependence, etc.), natural properties are not.
Ásta argues that if a property P is used to explain many social facts and seemingly many natural facts, but on closer inspection we can find (a) nearby property(s) that explain(s) the natural facts, then that property P is a social property. Thus, as sex as encoded on one's birth certificate explains many social facts, but the natural facts (ability to bear children, propensity for illnesses, ..) are in fact explained by chromosomes, hormones, other physical features, sex is a social property.

###### virtues

Ásta offers two virtues of her conferralist account: The conferral aspect, and the perception aspect.
conferral aspect|conferralism offers a story of the aquisition of a property (not just an outcome
perception aspect|conferralism cares about the perception of the base property and not its actual presence

##### mega social roles

A mega social role (coined by Charlotte WItt) is a social role which unifies other social roles and serves as their foundation (inflects them).
Charlotte Witt argues that the only mega social role is gender (-.-)

## philosophy of mind

Philosophy of Mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical body.


### dualism

mind-body dualism claims that mind and body are radically different types of things

### monism

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png

In the philosphy of mind, physicalism/materialism, idealism and neutral monism all are monistic theories
idealism claims that only mind and mental contents exist and that matter is reducible to it.
⟮c1;subjective idealism⟯ is the idea that only minds/mental contents of individual percievers exist.
George berkeley was the main proponent of subjective idealism.
objective idealism is the idea that only one mind exists, which does all the percieving.
⟮c1;Neutral monism⟯ claims that ultimate reality is neither mental nor physical and both mental and physical states are derived from a neutral entity.
neutral monism occupies a middle position between ⟮c1;idealism (only minds and mental contents exist) and Physicalism (only matter exists)⟯
⟮c1;materialism/physicalism⟯ holds that only matter exists and that mental states are reducible to it.

#### transcendental idealism

The noumenon/phenomenon distinction goes back to kant.
Something whose existance is in some way dependent human senses/perceptions   Phenomenon
Something that exists ⁑independent⁑ of human senses/perceptions   Noumenon

## philosophy of language

⟮c1;direction of fit⟯ is how words/speech acts/language and the world conform to each other.
there are two sets of distinctions in direction of fit: mind-to-world/world-to-mind and word-to-world/world-to-word
A mental state where the contents of the mental state are trying to model reality has mind-to-world direction of fit.
Mind-to-world mental states: beliefs
A mental state where the mental state is trying to change the world to fit their content has world-to-mind direction of fit.
World-to-mind mental states: desires
An utterance/text/whatever where the thing is trying to model the world has word-to-world direction of fit
An utterance/text/whatever where the world is changed as a reaction to the text it has world-to-word direction of fit
We write down the things already in our shopping cart onto a piece of paper   word-to-world direction of fit
We put things in a shopping cart based on what's on our shopping list   world-to-word direction of fit

A ⟮c2;loaded question⟯ is a question that ⟮c1;contains a controversial assumption (presupposition⟯) (e.g. ⟮c3;s2;have you stopped beating your wife⟯)

## logic

### modality

necessarily true   If it can't be false
necessarily false   If it can't be true
A proposition is contingent if it is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.
Counterfactual conditionals are conditional sentences which discuss what would have been true under different circumstances.

# practical philosophy

deontic   (adj) related to necessity/duty/obligation/morality = "should"
In a wide sense, deontology is synonymous with ethics, and in a narrow sense it is an ethical position.

## ethics

### ethical hedonism

Ethical hedonism claims that increasing pleasure and decreasing pain determines goodness/value.

#### experience machine

Nozick's 『Anarchy, State, and Utopia』 (1974) contains the famous experience machine thought experiment.
Nozick's 『Anarchy, State, and Utopia』 is said to be responding to Rawls' ⟮c1;A Theory of Justice⟯ (1971)
The Experience machine is a thought experiment against ethical hedonism.
For the experience machine thought experiment, one is offered to enter a machnine, which, while floating within it, would give us pleasurable experiences. We would not know we were in the machine (it would seem like real life to us), and the machine could not fail. 
Nozick argues one would not want to enter the experience machine, for example because it would limit us to a man-made reality, we want to be a certain sort of person, etc.

## demands

the original ⟮c9;catch-22⟯ (since ⟮c10;it's used in many different ways later in the book⟯): ⟮c1;If you're declared insane, you get sent home from fighting⟯:
-&gt; ⟮c11;s13-14;If you say you're insane (or apply for insanity⟯), that ⟮c12;s13-14;makes you sane, and so you still have to fight.⟯
-&gt; And ⟮c13;s11-12;if you don't say you're insane (or apply for insanity⟯) ⟮c14;s11-12;you still have to fight⟯. 
The ⟮c2;original⟯ ⟮c3;catch-22⟯ ⟮c2;from the book⟯ is ⟮c4;just a constructive dilemma⟯. 
The term ⟮c5;catch-22⟯ is also often used as ⟮c6;a synonym for deadlock (in the CS sense⟯). 
The term ⟮c7;catch-22⟯ may at its most broad just refer to ⟮c8;a kind of contradiction or problem involving 2 things.⟯ 
A double bind is a demand or set of demands which is/are not all fulfillable at the same time, thus automatically incurring whatever sanctions are attached to the demand.

# continental philosopy

## critical theory

Critical Theory (capital letters) was established by the Frankfurt School.
The Frankfurt School was established in the 1920.
Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse etc. are the most prominent members of The Frankfurt School

# history of philosophy

## feminism

### contemporary

⟮c2;Hypatia⟯ is perhaps the ⟮c3;most famous/important⟯ journal about ⟮c1;feminist philosophy⟯

#### the tuvel affair

In ⟮c1;2017⟯, the journal ⟮c2;hypatia⟯ published an article by ⟮c3;rebecca tuvel⟯ in favor of ⟮c4;transracialism⟯ (which led to a large controversy). ⟮s1-4;After it was released, an ⟮c5;open letter⟯ was ⟮c5;written⟯ requesting ⟮c6;the article be retracted⟯, signed by ⟮c7;800⟯ scholars. ⟮s5-7;The criticisms  related to tuvel herself were  ⟮c8;an alleged immersion in white and cisgender privilege⟯, related to the journal ⟮c9;an alleged mishandling of the review process⟯. ⟮s8-9;The ⟮c10;wider academic community⟯ reacted to ⟮c11;the open letter⟯ with ⟮c12;an outporing of support for Tuvel⟯. After the affair, the journal ⟮c13;was thrown into crisis⟯.⟯⟯⟯
The tuvel affair was seen by those who wanted to see it as such as a clash between analytic and continental philosophy.

## Kundera

In "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", Milan Kundera argues there are four audiences that people need (in different degrees) to look at them:
- Many anonymous people
- Many known people
- The person they love
- An imaginary audience
Drawing on Nietsche, in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" Milan Kundera ponders whether life is light or heavy.
To say life is heavy is to say that every decision and existence is incredibly meaningful, because there will never be an opportunity to redo it.
To say life is light is to say that every decision and existence is without meaning, because it will not recur and will therefore be lost to the eternal flow of time.

Utopia and dystopia both describe imaginary societies.
utopia|is great/nearly perfect
dystopia|is terrible, oppressive
