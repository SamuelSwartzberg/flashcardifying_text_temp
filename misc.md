## marxist

### base and superstructure

In marxism, ⟮society⟯ ⟮consists of⟯ two parts, ⟮the ＿base＿⟯ and ⟮the ＿superstructure＿⟯.
The »⟮base⟯« consists of ⟮forces and relations of production⟯.
The »⟮superstructure⟯« consists of ⟮culture, institutions, rituals, states, etc.⟯
In marxism, the ⟮base and superstructure⟯ ⟮reciprocally influence each other⟯, but ⟮the base is predominant⟯.

### universal equivalent

»⟮the universal equivalent⟯« is ⟮the measure⟯ by which ⟮all commodities⟯ are ⟮compared and exchanged⟯ 
To marx, ⟮money⟯ is the thing that eventually takes over the role of ⟮the universal equivalent⟯ in capitalism.

### value

To ⟮marx⟯, the ⟮exchange value⟯ of a good is ⟮how it can be exchanged for other commodities⟯
To ⟮marx⟯, the ⟮use value⟯ of a good is ⟮its tangible features/physical properties⟯ that  ⟮fulfill human needs/wants⟯
form|corresp. value|explanation
⟮natural form⟯|⟮use value⟯|⟮actual tangible form (the actual physical form, e.g. cloth, iron, etc.⟯)
⟮value form⟯|⟮exchange value⟯|⟮a good in relation to different commodities (e.g. 20 yards of linen = 1 coat⟯)

### labor

#### reproductive labor

»⟮reproductive labor⟯« is the work that ⟮reproduces other labor⟯.
⟮＿Reproductive labor＿⟯ is ⟮absolutely necessary⟯ - without ⟮c-;reproductive labor⟯, there ⟮would be no labor at all⟯.
⟮＿Reproductive labor＿⟯ consists of ⟮chores⟯ and ⟮childrearing⟯.

## nutrition

### practices

#### veganism

⟮Veganism⟯ is the practice of ⟮abstaining from the use of animal products⟯, particularly in ⟮diet⟯ 

### institutions

#### metrics

table:Abbreviation|Full
⟮EAR⟯|⟮Estimated Average Requirement⟯
⟮RDA⟯|⟮Recommended Dietary Allowance⟯


⟮RDAs⟯ are set higher than ⟮EARs⟯ to ⟮cover people with / situations where people have higher than average needs⟯. 

#### disagreements 

government organizations do not necessarily ⟮always agree⟯ on the ⟮amounts of nutrients⟯ needed to ⟮avoid deficiency⟯ or ⟮c_;maximum amounts⟯ (however, ⟮the ballpark is often similar⟯ )
⟮chromium⟯ is designated an ⟮essential nutrient⟯ by the ⟮US⟯ and ⟮c_;Japan⟯, but not the ⟮c_;EU⟯ 
^Sources: https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3845

#### veganism

⟮most health authorities⟯ recommend ⟮supplementing⟯ at least ⟮vitamin b12⟯ in ⟮vegan diets⟯ 

### antinutrients

»⟮Antinutrients⟯« are compounds that ⟮interfere with the absorption of nutrients⟯. 
⟮Phytate (=phytic acid)⟯ may be found in ⟮whole grains⟯, ⟮nuts/seeds⟯, and ⟮legumes⟯
⟮Phytate⟯ is an ⟮antinutrient⟯ which may ⟮inhibit⟯ ⟮iron⟯, ⟮zinc⟯ and to a lesser extent ⟮calcium⟯ ⟮absorption⟯.

### nutrients

A »⟮nutrient⟯« is a substance that an organism ⟮requires⟯ ⟮for good functioning / maintaining life⟯ 
⟮an »essential nutrient«⟯ is ⟮a ＿nutrient＿⟯ that ⟮cannot be synthesized by the body (⇒ must be consumed for survival)⟯ 
A ⟮nutrient⟯ is »⟮conditionally essential⟯« if ⟮synthesis may be limited in certain circumstances⟯
According to Marion Nestle (no relation), the ⟮list of essential nutrients⟯ is ⟮almost certainly incomplete⟯ 
»⟮Nutrient density⟯« is ⟮the ratio⟯ of ⟮＿nutrients＿⟯ to ⟮energy content⟯ 
An »⟮empty calorie⟯« is one from food with ⟮very low ＿nutrient density＿⟯

#### classification

Nutrients are divided into macro- and micronutrients.
⟮a micronutrient⟯ is ⟮a nutrient we require small amounts of⟯
⟮a macronutrient⟯ is ⟮a nutrient we require large amounts of⟯
⟮Macronutrient⟯ is sometimes used in the more ⟮restricted⟯ sense  ⟮macronutrient that provides energy⟯

#### macro

Macronutrients are divided into those containing food energy, and those that do not.
Macronutrients that don't contain food energy are water and fiber.

##### food energy

»⟮Food energy⟯« is ⟮energy⟯ derived from ⟮food⟯ 
⟮＿Food energy＿⟯ is generally measured in ⟮kilocalories⟯ 

###### calories

the »⟮calorie⟯«, in its proper definition, is ⟮the amount of energy⟯  ⟮needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one Kelvin / deg C⟯ 
⟮calorie⟯ is also sometimes nonstandardly called ⟮small calorie⟯, ⟮gram calorie⟯ 
⟮kilocalorie⟯ is also sometimes nonstandardly called ⟮calorie (confusingly, and mainly in casual conversation)⟯ ⟮large calorie⟯, ⟮food calorie⟯ 

###### Foods by food energy

1. ⟮fats⟯ 
2. ⟮alcohol(ethanol⟯) 
3. ⟮carbohydrates⟯/⟮protein⟯

###### carbs

⟮Saccharide⟯ is as far as I know a synonym for ⟮Carbohydrate⟯ 
⟮Carbohydrates⟯ may be classified as ⟮monosaccharides⟯, ⟮disaccharides⟯ or ⟮polysaccharides⟯ 

###### protein

⟮Proteins⟯ are made up of ⟮amino acids⟯ 
⟮Amino acids⟯ are ⟮organic⟯ compounds.
All ⟮Amino acids⟯ contain ⟮amino⟯ (–NH2) and ⟮carboxyl⟯ (–COOH) ⟮＿functional groups＿⟯
⟮Any amino acid⟯ has a ⟮side chain⟯ (⟮R group⟯) ⟮unique to it⟯
The key elements of an ⟮amino acid⟯ are ⟮carbon⟯, ⟮hydrogen⟯, ⟮oxygen⟯, and ⟮nitrogen⟯, although the ⟮side chains⟯ sometimes ⟮include others⟯
There are ⟮21⟯ ⟮amino acids⟯ ⟮common to all life forms⟯.
Of ⟮the 21 common amino acids⟯, for humans, ⟮nine⟯ are ⟮essential⟯, ⟮c-;six⟯ are ⟮conditionally essential⟯, and ⟮c-;six⟯ are ⟮non-essential⟯

###### fats

⟮Fat⟯ consists of (is an ester of, whatever that means) ⟮fatty acids⟯ 
⟮Fatty acids⟯ may either be ⟮saturated⟯ or ⟮unsaturated⟯. 

####### health

While the research is not completely settled, ⟮saturated⟯ and ⟮c_;trans unsaturated fats⟯ are generally considered ⟮unhealthy⟯ and ⟮c-;cis unsaturated fats⟯ considered ⟮healthy⟯

####### saturation

Saturation is about whether the fatty acid has C=C double bonds or only C-C single bonds.
»⟮Unsaturated⟯ fatty acids« ones have ⟮one or more⟯ ⟮C=C double bonds⟯.
»⟮saturated⟯ factty acids« have ⟮no⟯ ⟮C=C double bonds⟯. 
⟮Saturated fats⟯ are called that because they have the ⟮maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms⟯ ⟮attached to every carbon atom⟯, and thus no ⟮need (or possibility)⟯ for ⟮double C=C bonds⟯ 

######## unsaturated

⟮monounsaturated⟯ fats are ＿unsaturated fats＿ with ⟮one⟯ ⟮C=C double bond(s)⟯ 
⟮polyunsaturated⟯ fats are ＿unsaturated fats＿ with ⟮two or more⟯ ⟮C=C double bond(s)⟯  

######### cis and trans

⟮cis and trans⟯ are the two ways the ⟮structure of the molecule⟯ ⟮around the C=C double bond⟯ may be
Only ⟮unsaturated⟯ fats can be ⟮cis or trans⟯. 
^Since cis and trans⟯ fats refer to the structure around the ⁑C=C double bond⁑.
since an ⟮unsaturated fatty acid⟯ ⟮can have more than one double bond⟯, it ⟮can be both cis and trans⟯ 

######### omega

⟮all omega fatty acids⟯ are ⟮unsaturated fatty acids⟯.
⟮all omega (or maybe just all?) fatty acids⟯ ⟮end in⟯ ⟮a methyl group⟯.
⟮The number⟯ of ⟮the omega fatty acids⟯ indicates ⟮how many atoms away from the terminal methyl group⟯ ⟮a C=C double bound occurs⟯.
omega ⟮3 and 6⟯ are ⟮polyunsaturated fatty acids⟯.
omega ⟮7 and 9⟯ are ⟮monunsaturated fatty acids⟯.

########## omega-3

There are ⟮three⟯ types of ⟮omega-3⟯ fatty acids ⟮relevant to human nutrition⟯.
The ⟮three types of omega-3 fatty acids relevant to human nutrition⟯ are ⟮ALA⟯, ⟮EPA⟯, and ⟮DHA⟯.
of ⟮the three types of omega-3 fatty acids relevant to human nutrition⟯, only ⟮ALA⟯ is ⟮essential⟯.

Of the omega-3 fatty acids, only ⟮ALA is essential⟯ since ⟮EPA and DHA⟯ ⟮can be synthesized from the former⟯.
⟮EPA/DHA synthesis from ALA⟯ may be ⟮impaired in aging⟯ and generally is ⟮not a particularly efficient process⟯
Due to ⟮the flaws in EPA/DHA synthesis⟯ ⟮making sure to consume EPA/DHA⟯ is probably advisable.

########## omega-3

⟮there are a bunch of⟯ ⟮omega-6⟯ fatty acids, but only ⟮linoleic acid⟯ is ⟮considered essential⟯
⇱https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/⇲

########## sources

There are only ⟮two⟯ ⟮essential⟯ ⟮fatty acids⟯.
The ⟮essential fatty acids⟯ are one ⟮omega-3⟯ and one ⟮c_;omega-6⟯ fatty acid.
⟮ALA⟯ ⟮can be found⟯ ⟮in plant sources⟯.
⟮ALA⟯ plant sources are mainly ⟮seeds and nuts⟯.
⟮EPA and DHA⟯ are ⟮generally not found⟯ ⟮in plant sources⟯.
⟮alpha-linoleic acid⟯ ⟮can be found⟯ ⟮in plant sources⟯.

#### micro

##### fortification

Food ⟮fortification⟯ = ⟮enrichment⟯
food ⟮fortification/enrichment⟯ is the process of ⟮adding micronutrients⟯ ⟮to food⟯. 

##### genesis

⟮Minerals⟯ are ⟮originally found⟯ in ⟮rock, soil, or water⟯.
⟮Minerals⟯ ⟮from the rock/soil/water⟯ are ⟮absorbed by plants as they grow⟯.
⟮Minerals⟯ may also be absorbed by ⟮animals⟯ by ⟮them licking rocks⟯.
⟮Minerals⟯ are ⟮passed up the food chain⟯ until ⟮they end up in us humans⟯.
⟮What minerals we get⟯ from ⟮a certain plant/animal⟯ depends on ⟮which they can store⟯, but also ⟮what the soil/animals further down the food chain had in them⟯. 

##### vitamins

⟮Vitamins⟯ are produced by being ⟮＿biosynthesized＿⟯ by ⟮plants/animals⟯.
⟮Which vitamins⟯ are ⟮contained in food⟯ depend on ⟮what the relevant vegetable or animal can biosythesize⟯. 
Theoretically, all ⟮vitamins⟯ are defined to be ⟮essential nutrients⟯
⟮Vitamin D⟯ can be synthesized if ⟮exposed to sunlight (specifically UVB rays)⟯
Since Vitamin D can be synthesized by us, it is ⟮an exception⟯ to the idea that all Vitamins are essential
⟮vitamers⟯ are related molecules grouped together into one vitamin
Most ⟮vitamins⟯ are not ⟮single molecules⟯, but vitamers.
Each ⟮vitamin⟯ is typically used in ⟮multiple reactions⟯, and therefore ⟮most have multiple functions⟯. 
⟮Vitamin B12⟯ is ⟮the only⟯ ⟮vitamin or nutrient⟯ ⟮not available from plant sources.⟯ 

###### water/fat-soluble

⟮Vitamins⟯ are generally categorized as either ⟮water⟯- or ⟮fat⟯ soluble 
The ⟮water-soluble vitamins (the 8 B vitamins and vitamin C⟯) are ⟮easily excreted from the body⟯, thus generally ⟮hypervitaminosis (if referring to high storage levels⟯) is not an issue, therefore, however, ⟮consistent consumption is required⟯. 
Of the ⟮fat-soluble⟯ vitamins, ⟮A⟯ and ⟮D⟯ can ⟮accumulate in the body to a dangerous level⟯, resulting in ⟮hypervitaminosis⟯ 
⟮Hypervitaminosis⟯ is a condition of abnormally high ⟮storage levels (most of the time, although some sources also just use it for any overdose⟯) of ⟮vitamins⟯ 
In general, ⟮excess intake⟯ of vitamins is ⟮unlikely⟯ from ⟮food sources⟯, but possible via ⟮supplements⟯ 

##### minerals

⟮Minerals⟯ are ⟮micronutrients⟯ that ⟮are inorganic chemical elements⟯ 

###### macro/trace/ultratrace

⟮Minerals⟯ as micronutrients are subcategorized (by ⟮amount necessary⟯) into ⟮macrominerals⟯, ⟮trace minerals⟯, and ⟮ultratrace minerals⟯. 
There are many ⟮ultratrace⟯ elements that have been ⟮suggested as essential⟯, such claims are ⟮difficult to reproduce⟯. 


table:Mineral|Is defined by?
⟮Macrominerals⟯|⟮c+;RDA › 150-200mg/day⟯
⟮Trace minerals⟯|⟮c+;RDA › 150-200mg/day⟯

###### various minerals

####### iron

⟮Iron⟯ ⟮from food⟯ comes in two forms, ⟮heme⟯ ⟮iron⟯ which can only be gotten from ⟮animal flesh⟯, and ⟮non-heme⟯ ⟮iron⟯ which can also be gotten from ⟮other sources⟯ 
⟮Heme⟯ iron is ⟮better absorbed⟯ by the body than ⟮non-heme⟯ iron. 
Iron from ⟮non-heme⟯ sources is ⟮more readily absorbed⟯ if ⟮consumed with foods⟯ that contain either ⟮heme-bound iron⟯ or ⟮vitamin C⟯. 

##### choline

Choline is a micronutrient that is neither a mineral nor a vitamin.
⟮Choline⟯ is available in what feels like ⟮just about any food⟯, but is genrally highest in ⟮animal products (meat/fish/dairy/eggs⟯), which is why it is sometimes said ⟮vegans should pay some attention to it⟯ (prob not necessary tho). 

### food

#### vegetables

##### leafy greens

⟮Leaf(y) vegetable⟯ = ⟮leaf(y) green⟯
leafy greens are ⟮plant leaves⟯ eaten as ⟮a vegetable⟯
Leafy greens have that name since they are usually ⟮green⟯-colored.
leafy greens are grouped since they share ⟮many nutritional similarities⟯. 


# isms

## phenomena

### violence

#### behavioral and structural

⟮Structural violence⟯ is ⟮the tangible harm⟯ done by ⟮social structures⟯. 
⟮behavioral violence⟯ is ⟮the tangible harm⟯ done ⟮by agents volitionally⟯ 
⟮Structural violence⟯ is contrasted with ⟮behavioral violence⟯. 
However, in a second analysis, we might argue that ⟮we can reduce behavioral violence to structural violence⟯, for example via the concepts of ⟮stochastic/scripted terrorism/violence⟯ 
⟮about 300k deaths in a year in the US are attributable to income inequality⟯ is an example of ⟮structural violence⟯ 
⟮"Over 20 years’ worth of studies show that people of color who arrive at a hospital while having a heart attack are significantly less likely to receive aspirin, beta-blocking drugs, clot-dissolving drugs, acute cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, or bypass surgery."⟯ is an example of ⟮structural violence⟯ 

##### stochastic violence

⟮Stochastic violence⟯ is the idea of ⟮spreading a violent message via mass communication⟯, which ⟮makes resulting acts of violence⟯ ⟮probable⟯, but ⟮the actual place and time of the occurrence are⟯ ⟮random⟯. 
⟮Stochastic violence⟯ used for ⟮terrorism⟯ is called ⟮stochastic terrorism⟯ 
By ⟮transforming⟯ ⟮lone wolves⟯ ⟮into⟯ ⟮instances of larger patterns of violent messages⟯, ⟮stochastic violence⟯ ⟮unmasks behavioural violence⟯ as ⟮structural violence⟯ (perhaps) 
⟮Scripted violence⟯ is where ⟮someone describes the kind of violence they want to be carried out⟯, and then ⟮leaves it up to the audience to carry out this violence⟯. It may be seen as an instace of ⟮attempted stochastic violence/terrorism⟯

### +/-

any ism describes a structural system fundamentally defined by the contrast between two states/attributes, real or supposed.
For any ism, one state gets accorded significantly more of a bunch of positive stuff (influence, value, care, visibility etc.) while the other state gets accorded less or the opposite of this positive stuff, hence I call these states the + and - identity respectively.
+ and - also get other traits attached to them, creating two characters/charicatures, which are also placed in a contrastive relationship, which I call +traits and -traits as well as +characters and -characters.
+ and - also have a set of traits that constitute ideals for +/-ists while also being naturalized, which is called hegemonic +/-ity.
+ and - also of course create two groups of people who are in a + and a - state respectively, which I will call +ists and -ists respectively.
the experience that people with +/- identities = +/- experiences
Ambiguity is generally not tolerated, + and - are meant to be disjoint and S+ ∩ S- = U.
The power structure that an -ism establishes is called an -archy.
The totality of benefits that accrue to +ists because of an ism is »priviledge«.

For some isms, there seem to some to be an actual natural basis for the categorization into + and -, for those there have been attempts to separate + and - identities from their supposed natural bases. For me, I assume + and - are entirely socially constructed, and thus my models of isms rely on the separation or dismissal of any natural basis.

#### being-seen

throughout discourse (in the wide focaultian sense), +ists as well as the +experience is prioritized, thus the visibility of -ists and their experience is reduced:

x-normativity normalizes the + identity, experience and being a +ist of the relevant ism.
x-centrism places the + experience at the center of concern in a wide variety of areas, such that the + experience becomes enmeshed in the fabric of the social and built world.
Often x-normativity gives rise to one or more υ-cultures.
The sanctions that -ists face are such that many hide their - identity (stealth ＆ passing), thus the visibility of the - identity is further reduced.

Lack of visibility of - experiences, - identities, and -ists constitutes »erasure«.

The various ways in which the + experiences is prioritized and - visibility is reduced leads to low understanding for the - experience.
The - experience being not well understood is strengthened by and leads to more covering.
the - experience being not well understood and the traits associated with the -often leads to victim-blaming in response to violence against -ists.

+ traits are seen as (morally/value) good, and - traits as (morally/value) bad
- traits are seen to contain the seeds of evil, leading to a number of tropes with this premise.
- traits being seen as bad encourages pick-me x to act in such a way, in turn strenthening the idea of - traits as bad.
Due to - identity and traits being seen as undesirable, people with a - identity should wish to have a + identity instead.
x hegemony is the hierarchy between hegemonic +istity and hegemonic -istity.
x-normativity often causes equality to be identified as everyone becoming more like hegemonic +istity.
Besides the violence that having a - identity incurs, a mismatch between actual traits and traits expected by hegemonic - ity can produce sanctions, but so can having actual traits expected by hegemonic - ity = the double bind.
Hyper -ity is the extreme pursuit of the hegemonic -ity corresponding with one's - identity.
A model minority is a (part of a) - identity some of whose traits are seen positively.
A model minority's positively-seen traits serve to naturalize their negatively seen traits.
A model minority's positively-seen traits serve to contrast with other subidentities of the - identity.

+ fragility is the state in which having ⟮the relevant ism privilege mentioned⟯, even ⟮in a minor way⟯, ⟮triggers a deep defensive response⟯. This reaction functions (on a societal level if not consciously) to ⟮maintain the current -ism order⟯

##### details

###### culture

υ culture, where υ is an aspect of the - experience is the pervasiveness and normalization of υ.
υ culture often gives rise to victim-blaming.

similarly but slightly differently, ⟮Car culture⟯ (when it doesn't just mean ⟮an appreciation for cars⟯) refers to ⟮a culture/environment/society which is designed for and around cars.⟯

###### passing ＆ stealth

In a broad sense, a person that is passing is assumed to be part of a social group that they are not in fact a part of.
In a narrow sense, passing is being percieved as part of a + group though one is actually part of a - group.
To go/be/live stealth is to hide that one is the -value state of an ism, and especially that one is trans.
To ⟮out⟯ someone is to ⟮reveal that a person⟯ is ⟮a -value person of an ism⟯, generally ⟮without their consent⟯

###### covering

Covering is downplaying one's - identity by hiding or downplaying parts of the - identity.
The requirement to cover is not so much to hide one's - identity to make it as unobtrusive to people with + identities as possible, or to give people with + identities the least amount of opportunity to attack / sanction one.

###### victim-blaming

Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them.

###### depiction in media/discourse

####### death

Though it is not true for every ism, in generally characters with - identities are more likely to die, or die first.

ism|TVtropes trope|details
racism|Black Dude Dies First|(despite name, any non-white character)
sexism|Vasquez Always Dies|(mostly transgressive, 'masculine' women, despite the fact these should be more apt to survive (A/N: Really though? Masculinity is associated with unnecessary risk-taking etc.))
hetero ＆ cissexism|Bury Your Gays, Gay Guy Dies First
sexism|Slashers Prefer Blondes ＆ Final Girl|The blonde girl 'tainted by sexuality' dies first, while the final girl, who is 'pure' survies until the end.
ablism|Bury Your Disabled

####### evil

Any - identity has certain characteristics that 'explain' how they could easily become evil, hence villains tend to have one or more - identity. 
hetero/cissexism, ablism and sanism seem to produce - identity as villains especially frequently.


Sexism|"Woman as temptress"
Heterosexism|"Depraved Homosexual",
"Psycho Lesbian",
"Depraved Bisexual"
Ableism|"Evil Cripple"
Cissexism ＆ Sexism|"Sissy Villain", 
"Makeup Is Evil", 
"Creepy Crossdresser"
Sanism|Crazy Villain
Allosexism|"Villainous Aromantic Asexual"


###### chasers

A ⟮chaser⟯ ⟮fetishizes⟯ and thus ⟮pursues⟯ ⟮the - group of an ism⟯.˛ 

###### pick me

A pick me x (girl/gay/whatever) is a - person who tries to distinguish themselves from other - people by separating themselves from traits associated with - by treating those traits negatively, in order to gain approval from + people.

###### medical and social models

Many ⟮isms⟯ have ⟮a medical model⟯ and ⟮a social model⟯ of ⟮what it is to be a -value person⟯. 
The ⟮ social model⟯ of ⟮being a -ist⟯ argues that ⟮society creates the - and + identities⟯ from ⟮the way it's structured/its inherent problems⟯
The social model places the genesis of a - identity in society, the medical model in the individual.
The ⟮medical model⟯ of ⟮being a -value person⟯ argues that being a -ist is a natural feature.
The medical model of being a -value person argues one ⟮should aim to⟯ ⟮move from -value to +value⟯ if possible, if not, one should ⟮focus on⟯ ⟮seeming +value⟯, and if that's not possible, one should ⟮be erased⟯ (often via ⟮special institutions⟯).
For isms with a medical model, the negativity associated with having a - identity is institutionalized and thus 'objectified'/naturalized in the medical field.
Neurodiversity is an attempt to reframe the distinction between + and - identities (sane and insane) within sanism as a value-neutral distinction between human mental traits.

###### pay gap

The ⟮x pay gap⟯ or ⟮x wage gap⟯ is the ⟮difference between the remuneration⟯ ⟮for - group and + group of an ism⟯ for ⟮work⟯. 
There are two forms of ⟮x pay/wage gap⟯, ⟮non-adjusted⟯ and ⟮adjusted.⟯ 
The ⟮non-adjusted⟯ ⟮pay gap⟯ {{c11::just takes into account the difference in average pay} 
The ⟮adjusted⟯ ⟮pay gap⟯ ⟮adjusts for factors such as employee's age, education level, years of work experience, occupation, industry, location, company and job title⟯ 
The pay gap that it was coined for was the ⟮gender pay gap⟯, there is however also ⟮strong evidence for pay gaps for other - groups,⟯ such as ⟮the race pay⟯ gap. 
For ⟮intersectional identities⟯, ⟮pay gaps⟯ can be ⟮stark indeed⟯, for example, ⟮black women⟯ are payed ⟮63 cents⟯ and ⟮latina women⟯ just ⟮55 cents⟯ (both ⟮non-adjusted) ⟯ for ⟮each dollar a white man makes.⟯ 

###### ceiling

the x ceiling is the unofficial/uncodified/'invisible' limit on career advancement that people with a certain - identity face.
heterosexism|lavender ceiling
sexism|glass ceiling
racism (asian-american)|bamboo ceiling
nativisim (refugees)|canvas ceiling
classism|class ceiling

Importantly, the cotton ceiling is the exclusion of trans people from consideration as sexual partners, not anything to do with employment.

####### cliff

the ⟮x cliff⟯ is the idea that even if ⟮people with a - identity⟯) ⟮s4;s5;⟮break through the glass ceiling⟯⟯, they are often given ⟮executive positions⟯ during ⟮periods of crisis/downturn⟯, where ⟮s5; ⟮the risk of failure is highest⟯, e.g. ⟮s6;c7;Ellen Pao at reddit, Thresa May after brexit.⟯⟯

#### resistance

For any ism, the dominant position is that -ists should stay invisible and quiet, to allow for erasure.
Thus, hegemonic -ity always includes not aiming to upset the status quo.

#### consciousness

We might say political consciousness is seeing/recognizing the relevant ism as structuring the world (at least in part), coming to realize your part in a community of -ists, and thus understanding ⟮problems⟯ and ⟮remedies⟯ in ⟮terms of political action⟯
ergo: race-consciousness → political consciosuness regarding racism etc.
false consciousness is the failure to gain political consciousness or to gain the wrong sort of political consciousness.
false consciousness happens due to all the ways the relative ism distorts thinking and seeing.
Marxism argues that without false consciousness (at least in the case of capitalism), the -ists would overthrow the +ists.

##### origin: class consciousness

⟮class consciousness⟯ (in a sort of general sense) is ⟮political consciousness⟯ (in the sense of ⟮seeing one's experience and struggle as part of a group⟯) of ⟮social classes⟯, and since it's a ⟮marxist⟯ term, esp. of ⟮the proletariat⟯ and ⟮the capitalists⟯. ⟮Class consciousness⟯ is the ⟮original⟯ term, is ⟮more common⟯ than ⟮political consciousness⟯ as a term, and is thus also ⟮often used as a synonym.⟯

### intersectionality

⟮intersectionality⟯ considers ⟮social identities⟯ and concomittant ⟮oppression/domination⟯ and ⟮privilege⟯ in ⟮combination⟯, rather than ⟮considering each factor in isolation⟯. 
⟮Intersectionality⟯ was coined by ⟮Crenshaw⟯ in ⟮1989⟯ and started ⟮being popular as a framework⟯ in ⟮the early 2000s⟯ 
In 1989, Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term "⟮intersectionality⟯" in a paper as a way to help explain the ⟮oppression of African-American women⟯. She argues the experience of being a ⟮black woman⟯ ⟮cannot be understood⟯ in terms ⟮independent of either being black or a woman⟯. Rather, it must include ⟮interactions between the two identities⟯, which, she adds, frequently reinforce one another. 
⟮Tripple oppression⟯ is a term developed originally by ⟮black socialists in the US⟯, which refers to (in our modern terminolgy) ⟮the intersectional experience⟯ of ⟮black women⟯ at the nexus of ⟮classism, racism, and sexism⟯

### x work/x-al labor

⟮Hochschild⟯ coined the terms ⟮emotion work/emotional labor⟯. 
On ⟮the model of⟯ emotion work/emotional labor, other ⟮more or less common terms have been coined⟯. 
While ⟮some people⟯ treat ⟮emotion/x work and emotional/x-al labor⟯ as ⟮synonyms⟯, there is ⟮a clear distinction⟯. 

|value|example
⟮x work, e.g. emotion work⟯|⟮use value only⟯|⟮c+;s16:17;part of a job⟯
⟮x-al labor, e.g. emotional labor⟯|⟮use value and exchange value⟯|⟮c+;s19:20;in an intimate relationship⟯


type of work/labor|involves|example
⟮emotion work/emotional labor⟯|⟮managing our own emotions⟯ (Hochschild (complementary but not equivalent): "⟮creating a publically observable display⟯")|⟮c+;sb;a waiter gets insulted, goes through a ritual in his head and still appears friendly⟯
⟮empathy work/empathical labor⟯|⟮creating the feeling of being understood in others⟯
⟮conversation work/conversational labor⟯|⟮maintaining a conversation (if it has a purpose that both parties subscribe to⟯)|⟮c+;sb;a person tries hard to come up with relevant topics and questions during a date/a meeting with a long-lost relative⟯
⟮interpretion work/interpretive labor⟯|⟮modelling the others perspective⟯|⟮c+;sb;A person gets handed a form with an ambiguous question and tries to understand what the institution wants from them.⟯


The two strategies people use in performing ⟮emotion work/labor (not sure in how far it applies to the family of similar concepts⟯ are  ⟮surface acting and deep acting⟯ 
⟮emotion work/labor⟯ by ⟮getting into a state where one genuinely feels the emotions⟯ is called ⟮deep acting⟯ 
⟮emotion work/labor ⟯ by ⟮pretending, without changing how one actually feels⟯ is called ⟮surface acting⟯
